Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges. 
This rank badge features a golden pheasant, representing a second-rank civil official. It is perched on a rock and gazing at a sun disc in the top left corner. Surrounding the birds in this badge are clouds and waves. This badge is embroidered with gold and silver metal-wrapped thread and details rendered in multi-coloured silk floss.",,gold wrapped silk thread; silk; silk gauze; silk satin; silver wrapped silk thread; beads; silk floss; embroidery,"Embroidery

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. 
This rank badge features a peacock, representing a third rank civil official. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges. It is perched on a rock and gazing at a sun disc in the top left corner. The eight Buddhist treasures are scattered throughout the design, including a parasol, endless knot, lotus blossom, victory banner, wheel, vase, carp, and conch shell.

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a bear embroidered in gold metal-wrapped and multicoloured silk floss, which represents a fifth rank military official. Bears and lions are often confused on rank badges, as the bear has a mane and tail that appears similar to a lion's. However, a bear's tail curls only at the base, whereas a lion's tail curls at the base and tip. A lion also has a curly mane, while a bear's mane hangs in straight tendrils. 
The front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. The sun on the right side of these badges indicates that the wearer was female, likely the spouse of a military official. The bear, positioned at the center of the badge, is surrounded by flames, clouds, rocks, and standing water waves. A flaming wheel, a Buddhist symbol, can be seen amongst the waves with other obscured treasures. There are bats throughout the sky, which are a symbol of good luck. Many flowers are embroidered in the background, including peonies. Gold metal-wrapped threads outline auspicious symbols and also make up the geometric border design.",,gold wrapped silk thread; silk; silk floss; silk satin; embroidery,"Embroidery

While he uses only a few strokes to outline, the expressions accurately convey the subject’s inner life and character. For instance, we can tell from his attire that Qi Baishi was a very traditional man, and we seem to feel his insightful gaze penetrating through his lenses.

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a silver pheasant representing the fifth rank of a civil official. This bird is identified by its white feathers, white crown with a red stripe and long tail.
The front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. This rank badge pair was decorated with delicate seed stitches, also referred to as “Peking knots” or ta tzu. Gold metal-wrapped thread is couched around some of the colourful motifs as a border. In the centre of the badge, a silver pheasant, standing on rocks above waves, looks toward a red sun in the upper left corner. An embellished canopy floats above the bird, while the Eight Buddhist treasures surround it, including lotuses, the wheel, the parasol, the vase, the conch, the fish and the endless knot. The border of the badge is decorated with blue and white floral motifs and gold geometric patterns.",,gold wrapped silk thread; silk damask; silk floss; silk satin; embroidery,"Damask; Embroidery

													The army stationed in the West successfully achieved its task in 1759. It is only a little more than seven years from the end of the battles, in 1766, that the drawings of the conquests were finished. The painters needed this space of time in order to meticulously inquire into [what] the forms of the camps and battles [looked like] so as to compose their designs. Of the officers and soldiers who left for the campaigns and risked their lives at extreme odds, one out of a hundred survived. Giving their lives to the state ensured that their campaigns were successful, so how could I suggest that they die without recognition? That is why in the Throne Hall of the Purple Effulgent Pole Star (Ziguangge 紫光閣) we have had the portraits painted of those who distinguished themselves. And because of this motivation, we went to the bloody battlefields, we faithfully depicted the circumstances where attacks were made on our strongholds--where we broke the ardour of the enemy, beheaded the generals, and stole the flags--in order to pay homage to their efforts and to celebrate their courage. When I reviewed the military reports I dedicated some poems to them, and I rewrote them to be placed between the folios. For the six scenes that I have not yet touched with my brush [meaning he had yet inscribed them with poetry], I have dedicated special supplementary poems. When I hear the sound of the drums, then I think [I am reminded] of the generals and soldiers, who are our state. These paintings inspired the same feeling in me. Before the completion of these paintings, I constantly imagined myself touring the battleground even during my busy dealings of government affairs at court. Now with these paintings that show everything vividly before my eyes, I feel as if I am commanding the soldiers on the battlefield…

Sorrowfully inscribed by the Qianlong emperor in the spring of February-March, 1766

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a bear embroidered in gold metal-wrapped and multicoloured silk floss, which represents a fifth rank military official. Bears and lions are often confused on rank badges, as the bear has a mane and tail that appears similar to a lion's. However, a bear's tail curls only at the base, whereas a lion's tail curls at the base and tip. A lion also has a curly mane, while a bear's mane hangs in straight tendrils. 
The front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. The sun on the right side of these badges indicates that the wearer was female, likely the spouse of a military official. The bear, positioned at the center of the badge, is surrounded by flames, clouds, rocks, and standing water waves. A flaming wheel, a Buddhist symbol, can be seen amongst the waves with other obscured treasures. There are bats throughout the sky, which are a symbol of good luck. Many flowers are embroidered in the background, including peonies.

The front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. This rank badge pair was decorated with smooth satin stitches surrounded by couched metal-wrapped threads. Bats (which represent fortune) and auspicious motifs are scattered among coin-shaped clouds. The background is filled with green geometric lines and  wan symbols (similar in form, but not ideology, to a swastika), which symbolize infinity. In the centre of the badge is a silver pheasant standing on rocks above the waves and water, looking toward a red sun in the upper right corner.

The paintings were done by Ren Yi, also known as Ren Bonian (1840-1895). He was born in Shaoxing, Zhejiang. In 1868, he relocated to Shanghai. This move brought him into a more urban environment that was influenced by Western ideas. In Shanghai, he became part of the Shanghai School, which merged popular and traditional artistic styles. Ren Bonian was recognized alongside Ren Xiong, Ren Xun, and Ren Yu as one of the ""Four Rens."" 
The calligraphic poems were crafted by Liu Taixi (1899-1989), a calligrapher commissioned by Zhou Maifu (1929-2011). Based on the inscription on 2004.19.38.20, written by the calligrapher Taixi at the age of 86, the estimated date for the calligraphy is around 1985, nearly 90 years after Ren Yi's death. The time difference indicates that the inscriptions were added to the paintings at a much later date (ca.1985).
The golden-yellow cover is made of damask, featuring swirling cloud motifs and circular medallions containing dragons. This album opens vertically. Once flipped open, the top portion features an inscription, while the bottom half displays a painting framed by a damask border with wavy patterns. Both the inscription and the painting are mounted on a large sheet of yellow paper, with the yellow edges visible around the borders.",Each painting is signed by the artist and each painting is also impressed with at least one artist seal.

The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a tiger embroidered in metal-wrapped threads, which represents a fourth rank military official. The tiger is identified by its black stripes and a wan symbol on its forehead, indicating the tiger is a king. 
The front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. The embroidery on this badge is rendered entirely in metal-wrapped threads of varying hues, all expertly couched in place with silk floss. The border contains bats and shou characters, which all act as lucky symbols for the wearer. The tiger is positioned in the middle of the badge, above rocks and standing water waves and surrounded by a sky filled with clouds and lotus flowers. The position of the sun on the right side of the badge indicates that the wearer was a woman, likely the spouse of a military official. The tiger is appliquéd onto the badge background so that it may be easily replaced with other beasts as the military official moves up through the ranks.",,gold wrapped silk thread; silk; silk satin; silver wrapped silk thread; embroidery,"Embroidery

This painting is the second scroll of 12 and it depicts the royal procession traveling along the Grand Canal after leaving Beijing, about to enter the city of Dezhou in Shandong province.
The handscroll is quite large, measuring 68.5 x 1686.5 cm, and is viewed from right to left. The painting begins with a poetry inscription by Yu Mingzhong (1714-1779) and has two small seals after his signature. Seven of Emperor Qianlong's seals are impressed on the scroll at the beginning of the painting, including three big square red seals. 
On the right side of the scroll, the painting features the emperor's escorts and procession. They are crossing the Grand Canal on a floating bridge, surrounded by crowds of local officials and other inhabitants kneeling on either shore, welcoming the Emperor’s procession.
Further along in Dezhou, we see officials and other residents anticipating the Emperor’s arrival, as well as architecture and daily life activities in the 18th century. After Dezhou, moving left along the scroll, we see the suburbs outside of the town. Several mounted officers, some of them pulling carts, seem to be part of an advanced imperial entourage going ahead to scout the path for Qianlong Emperor’s smooth journey (Tsang, Ka bo, 2008).
At the left end of the picture impressed a small rectangular red seal by the collector Jin Cheng (1879-1926). The seal inscribes six characters as “Jin Gong Bo jing jian yin.” The handscroll has an original carved jade clasp inscribed with the names of Emperor Qianlong, the artist Xu Yang, and the title of the handscroll.","There is an inscription by Yu Minzhong (1714-1779), and another inscription of  a poem by the Emperor Qianlong.

He commissioned imperial artist Wang Hui (1632-1717) to document the second tour in 12 handscrolls. This painting is the seventh scroll of the series, which depicts the route from Wuxi to Suzhou during the Emperor’s second tour in 1689.
The front fringe of the mounted scroll has one label with three parts: “the picture of the southern inspection tour” (nan-xun-tu), “the seventh scroll “ (di-qi juan), and “the route from Wuxi county to the emperor’s accommodation at Suzhou’s official residence” (zi-wuxi-xian zhubi suzhou-fu). At the beginning of the handscroll, which is viewed from right to left, a poetry inscription, titled “Reverence picture of the seventh scroll”, describes people welcoming the Emperor’s procession along the route. The poetry also honours Emperor Kangxi for his mercy and granting tax waivers to the Suzhou people. The scroll bears no red seals.
Following the inscription, the painting begins with the countryside scenery of Qingyuan, Huishan temple, and Xishan. Further along, we see Wuxi county with boats on the river and busy streets along the canal. Afterwards, the scenery shows Xin-an, Hu-shu-guan (a bustling city with cargo ships and tax collecting near the Grand Canal), Shan-tang, and Hu-Qiu. In all of these places there is flourishing urban life, both on the streets and the river. Following these cities, we see Chanmen (the Chan gate) of Suzhou and the Emperor’s procession in ships surrounded by a welcoming parade on the dock. The scene moves into the city of Suzhou, showing the busy streets with decorations and the gathering crowds anticipating the Emperor’s arrival. Further to the left, near the end of the painting, we see the Suzhou Weaving Office, which is preparing for the Emperor’s arrival.",The colophon is inscribed with a description of the events depicted on the scroll.,ink and colour on silk,,sheet: 68.8 cm x 2932.4 cm; image: 67.7 cm x 2220 cm,handscroll,Qing 17th century,China,"Kangxi Emperor's Southern Inspection Tour, Scroll Seven: Wuxi to Suzhou"

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a goose, which represents the fourth rank of a civil official.
The front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. This rank badge pair was decorated with counted stitch embroidery made from polychrome silk floss and metal-wrapped threads. In the center of the badge is a goose standing on rocks and surrounded by waves. The bird is looking toward a red sun at the upper left corner. Blue curvilinear clouds fill the background of the top of the badge, while interlinked ruyi clouds form a line underneath the waves. The bottom shows diagonal stripes, representing standing water, woven in two-toned metal-wrapped threads. The Eight Buddhist Treasures are scattered throughout, including the parasol, canopy, endless knot and lotus in the sky, and the vase, fish, conch, and wheel in the waves. The border of the badge features black embroidery with bats (which represent fortune) and longevity characters.",,gold wrapped silk thread; linen; silk; silk floss; silver wrapped silk thread; embroidery,"Embroidery

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. 
This rank badge features an egret, representing a sixth rank civil official. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird was seen on rank badges. The egret in this badge is surrounded by ruyi-shaped clouds, with its wings outstretched and its gaze fixed on the sun disk in the upper left corner.

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a tiger embroidered in metal-wrapped threads, which represents a fourth rank military official. The tiger is identified by its black stripes and a wan symbol on its forehead, indicating the tiger is a king. 
The front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. The embroidery on this badge is rendered entirely in metal-wrapped threads of varying hues, all expertly couched in place with silk floss. The border contains bats and shou characters, which all act as lucky symbols for the wearer. The tiger is positioned in the middle of the badge, above rocks and standing water waves and surrounded by a sky filled with clouds and lotus flowers. The position of the sun on the right side of the badge indicates that the wearer was a woman, likely the spouse of a military official. The tiger is appliquéd onto the badge background so that it may be easily replaced with other beasts as the military official moves up through the ranks.",,gold wrapped silk thread; silk; silk satin; silver wrapped silk thread; embroidery,"Embroidery

The overall composition reveals artist Zhang Hong’s diligent study of Chinese “orthodox” landscape painting skills. Orthodox painting focuses on the natural world and the depiction of landscapes as idealized and harmonious spaces, with an emphasis on brushwork, composition and the use of ink wash. Zhang incorporates orthodox school techniques in his painting through the use of brushstrokes to create a sense of movement and dynamism, as well as the delicate balance of gradient tones to depict natural elements. His emphasis on negative space in the depiction of clouds and waterfalls is a technique often used in the orthodox school, and helps to create a sense of depth and space within the painting.",Signed Zhang Hong.,ink and colour on paper,,sheet: 207.6 cm x 82.4 cm; image: 94.9 cm x 64.5 cm,hanging scroll,Modern 20th century,"United States: New York, New York",Pink Mountains

The front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. The embroidery on this badge is rendered entirely in metal-wrapped threads of varying hues, all expertly couched in place with silk floss. The border contains bats and shou characters, which all act as lucky symbols for the wearer. The tiger is positioned in the middle of the badge, above rocks and standing water waves and surrounded by a sky filled with clouds and lotus flowers. The position of the sun on the right side of the badge indicates that the wearer was a woman, likely the spouse of a military official. The tiger is appliquéd onto the badge background so that it may be easily replaced with other beasts as the military official moves up through the ranks.",,gold wrapped silk thread; silk; silk satin; silver wrapped silk thread; embroidery,"Embroidery

The Qin bridge is the legendary place where Qin Shi Huang, founder of the Qin Dynasty and Emperor, fed his horses on his eastern tour. The upper part of the scroll is mainly composed of rocky mountain cliffs, with the Qin bridge and a house below. Lai Shaoqi (1915 -2000) employs different-sized colour blocks to represent the unusual rocks and utilizes comparatively fine brush strokes to sketch the house under the mountain. He uses diluted ink, ochre, and stone blue (shi qing, 石青) in layers to create a heavy, yet tranquil painting.

In Tibet, tailors modified the collar and sleeves to  suit the local style better. Thus the robe has yellow satin parts, without embroidery patterns, around the neckline and sleeve ends. The robe features motifs of dragons with flaming pearls, long thin clouds, rocks, waves and colourful striped water at the hem. There are eight dragons on the exterior of the robe: one on the chest, one on the back, one on each shoulder, and two on the front and back of the lower robe. As is typically seen in Chinese dragon robes, there is a hidden ninth dragon underneath the right overlap.
There are the Twelve Symbols embroidered on the robe: the sun with a three-legged bird and the moon with a rabbit are placed on shoulders, stars and mountains are above the dragon’s head on the front and back, dragons, a pheasant, an axe, the fu symbol, cups, seaweed, flames, and grain.

During the Qing dynasty, mourning costume, or sangfu, was white or light coloured and was meant to be worn for a specified period of time, depending on the relationship of the mourner to the decedent and the decedent’s social status. The female figure, on the left, wears a white cloth covering her head, as well as a long white jacket over a light brown pleated skirt (likely made from hemp). She also appears to have bound feet, and may be of Han descent. The male figure, on the right, wears a light brown hat and robe (also likely made from hemp) over white leggings.

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts.
This rank badge features a silver pheasant, representing a fifth rank civil official. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges. It is perched on a rock and gazing at a sun disc in the top right corner. The pattern on the badge is embroidered with fine seed stitches of multicoloured silk floss.

The silk multicoloured tapestry has motifs of dragons, clouds, waves and rocks. The green silk brocade with metal-wrapped threads is patterned with floral and xi characters, which mean happiness.
The inner section is pieced together from fragments of Chinese tapestry. That shows two dragons face to face, yet one of the dragons has been cut off on the right side. The dragons, which have four claws on each foot,  are both standing on one leg. Their  heads face upward with open mouths that show off their pointy white teeth. The ends of their tails resemble fishtails sweeping the tops of the waves and mountains below. The images of the dragons’ postures, sharp teeth, fierce claws, and muscular tails reveal a design style of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644).",,gold wrapped silk thread; silk brocade; polyester; silk tapestry weave; silk twist,"Tapestry Weave; Brocade
