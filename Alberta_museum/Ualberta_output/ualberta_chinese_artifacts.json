On the right side of the scene, there is a man standing on a bridge observing the landscape around him.",

        "Description": "Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a leopard rendered in tapestry weave with details painted with ink, representing a third rank military official. The leopard is identified by its spots, which look like geometric marks throughout its body, and green eyebrows, which are typical in the late Qing dynasty.\nThe front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. The leopard is positioned in the center of the badge, surrounded by clouds, small white flowers, bats, and other auspicious symbols. Select details are highlighted with metal-wrapped threads, including the standing water waves below the leopard. The position of the sun on the right side of the badge indicates that the wearer was a woman, likely the spouse of a military official. The border features show characters and bats, which are symbols of luck.",

        "Description": "Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. \nThis rank badge features a flycatcher, representing a ninth rank civil official. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges. The bird perches on rocks, surrounded with bamboo and cherry blossoms. The badge is adorned with counted stitch embroidery on silk gauze.",

The crane is standing on a rock amidst multi-coloured waves, pink peonies, trees, and clouds. The motifs on these badges have been rendered in tapestry weave with a brilliant gold background. The front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. The sun on the left side of these badges indicates that the wearer was male.",

        "Description": "Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a goose, which represents the fourth rank of a civil official.\nThe front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. This rank badge pair was decorated with counted stitch embroidery made from polychrome silk floss and metal-wrapped threads. In the center of the badge is a goose standing on rocks and surrounded by waves. The bird is looking toward a red sun at the upper left corner. Blue curvilinear clouds fill the background of the top of the badge, while interlinked ruyi clouds form a line underneath the waves. The bottom shows diagonal stripes, representing standing water, woven in two-toned metal-wrapped threads. The Eight Buddhist Treasures are scattered throughout, including the parasol, canopy, endless knot and lotus in the sky, and the vase, fish, conch, and wheel in the waves. The border of the badge features black embroidery with bats (which represent fortune) and longevity characters.",

        "Description": "The painting is associated with the poem (2004.19.38.24). It shows a man walking barefoot beside a dark-colored donkey. He carries a bundle on his back, wrapped in cloth and securely tied. The load is so heavy that he is bent over. His attire is simple and loose-fitting, suggesting that he is a laborer from a lower class. The horse, moving ahead of the man, is slightly turned to the side with its head lowered, either grazing or resting.\nOn the right side, Ren Yi wrote “the Seal of Bonian [伯年 印]” along with his red personal seal.",

        "Description": "Shi Lu was a prominent Chinese painter and wood engraving artist. Shi was known for his highly textured, dynamic paintings that employed strong colors and bold, expressive brushwork. Shi was originally named Feng Yaheng but later changed his name to Shi Lu in honour of two artists who influenced his work: the 17th-century painter Shitao and the 19th-century writer Lu Xun. He received training in guohua painting (a traditional Chinese style of ink-and-wash painting) at Dongfang Art College in Chengdu in 1934 before enrolling at West China Union University in Chengdu in 1938. After joining the Communist Party in 1946, Shi incorporated elements of social realism into his style. He travelled to India and Egypt as a representative of the People's Republic of China in 1955-56. During the Cultural Revolution, he was publicly denounced and imprisoned for three years due to the “Hei Hua shijian” (The Black Painting exhibition), which criticized his bourgeois ideas and \"counter-revolutionary\" styles. The experience led to severe persecution and humiliation on him. Although he was released in 1970, his imprisonment caused his health to deteriorate until his death in 1982.",

The more ornately-dressed woman on the right, “Lady of Nankin”, wears a green pleated skirt under an orange skirt with long decorated ribbons. The orange skirt may be a part of her purple robe, which has a green collar and wide sleeves with many ribbons decorating the cuff. She also wears a golden crown, earrings and a gold necklace.",

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This rank badge features a crane, representing a first rank civil official. It is centrally-positioned, perched on a rock with its wings outstretched, gazing toward the sun in the upper left corner. Surrounding the birds are peonies, clouds, and auspicious ornaments.",

        "Description": "A dark blue silk surcoat (or bufu) with tapestry woven rank badges on the front and back. There is a crane, recognizable with a red cap on its head, depicted on the square rank badges, identifying the wearer as a first-rank civil official. The position of the sun on the left side of the badge (the wearer's right side) indicates that the wearer is a man. Auspicious symbols, including bats for good fortune and a geometric wan - multiplying good fortune by an infinite amount - in the background, surround the crane and there is a standing water and waves motif below. This surcoat has a typical front opening with five brass buttons, two side vents, and a standing collar. The standing collar is not a typical design feature on surcoats, which can be seen when compared to other examples in the collection, such as Blue Silk Gauze Surcoat for a Man (2005.5.93). This robe design has likely been modified from a traditional surcoat, including longer and narrower sleeves, and may not be typical official’s attire. The lining fabric is a pale blue plain weave silk.",

Each leaf contains a landscape, which was painted in situ by Wang Gai. Repeating themes throughout the album include figures immersed in the natural environment, which reflects the literati’s yearning and nostalgia.\nIn this scene, a fisherman sits on a boat watching a flock of birds fly towards the horizon. He appears relaxed, with a fishing line hanging off the side of the boat. The three clusters of river bamboo on the side of the boat are painted with different tones of black ink to indicate depth. The fading of the distant bamboo into the background is a technique found throughout this album.",

There are two children playing, showing the normalcy of the scene in daily life. With flat, vivid colours and a narrative scene progressing as the eye moves through the painting, this folk art work represents part of the cultural life of farmers in Shanxi.",

The front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a crane, which is identified by its red crown and white feathers. The crane is standing on a rock amidst multi-coloured waves, pink peonies, trees, and clouds. The motifs on these badges, which are identical for the front and back, have been rendered in tapestry weave with a brilliant gold background. The sun on the left side of these badges indicates that the wearer was male.",

Typically, a rank badge features a single animal symbolizing the wearer's rank. However, on the left sleeve, there is a lion representing a second rank military officer, while the right sleeve displays a leopard symbolizing the third military rank. At the center, where the blue dragon is intersected, two qilin badges—indicating the first military rank—are repeated, alongside a panther badge representing the sixth military rank. On the back, the central section includes two crane badges, signifying the first rank for civil officials and a panther badge. These additional segments extend both the body and sleeve lengths, suggesting that the original dragon-patterned fabric was not sized for the Tibetan owner.",

        "Description": "The painting is associated with the poem (2004.19.38.22). An elderly figure stands next to a large, white horse. The person appears to be guiding or holding the horse by a leash. He only shows his back, with his head slightly turned to the left, as if glancing back to check on the horse. The horse is slightly bent forward, grazing or simply standing peacefully. The background is made up of soft, misty brushstrokes, depicting a serene landscape with muted colors. \n\nThe inscription on the right states, “Written by Ren Yi, also known as Ren Bonian, from Shanyin, over the Huangpu River [畯師冬心居士(金農)法書山陰任頤伯年寫於浦上].”",

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. \nThis rank badge features a wild goose, symbolizing a fourth rank civil official. Perched on a rock amid waves, the goose gazes toward the sun disc in the upper right corner. Ruyi-shaped clouds and bats decorate the sky. The badge is woven in tapestry (kesi), and ink was used for details and colour gradation.",

However, in 1916, Yuan Shikai attempted to restore the Qing Empire by declaring himself Emperor Hongxian. This embroidered roundel, featuring the Twelve Symbols of Imperial Authority, serves as an example of his effort to invoke imperial imagery. There are nine motifs of the Twelve Symbols embroidered on the roundel, including a pair of cups, seaweed, fire, grain, an axe, a pheasant, a dragon, mountains and the fu character in the centre. Encircling the entire composition is a border of circular ruyi-shaped clouds.",

It contains more than one hundred fragments pieced together on the front, back and the front left flap. That implies Tibetans highly valued Chinese silks and reused them to avoid waste.\nAt the center front of the robe there is a tapestry fragment depicting a phoenix standing on a rock in a peony garden. Below, two large tapestry fragments with descending blue dragons are pieced together near the hem. A large green and red dragon, portrayed in tapestry weave with gold metal-wrapped threads, is on the centre back. Under this dragon are two blue dragons leaping above waves, rocks and water. Interestingly, the dragons on the front and back of the robe have hooves instead of claws.\nMore patterns are on the top of the robe, such as cranes, frogs, lotus diamond-shapes, and other auspicious ornaments. They include secular and religious longing representing longevity, wealth, fortune, and purity.",

        "Description": "Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges. \nThis Ming-era rank badge features a pair of golden pheasants, representing a second-rank civil official. Surrounding the birds in this badge are peonies and clouds. The lower bird is perched on a scholar's rock, which are particularly-shaped rocks appreciated by the literati and found in Chinese gardens. This badge is woven in tapestry, with a ground made from gold-wrapped thread and details rendered in multi-coloured silk floss.",

This leaf has an ink and watercolour drawing of two different forms of confinement punishments. The male figure on the left, in a red tunic and blue pants, sits in a barred cage with a chain around his neck. The figure on the right sits in a structure with their head in a square wooden collar, sometimes referred to as a cangue, which acts as a portable pillory. The crime of the figure would have been written on the vertical white stripes on either side of their head. During the Qing Dynasty these types of punishments were a form of public humiliation.",

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts.  In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges.\nThis Ming-era rank badge features a pair of peacocks, representing a third-rank civil official. Surrounding the birds in this badge are peonies and clouds. This badge is woven in tapestry, with a ground made from gold-wrapped thread and details rendered in multi-coloured silk floss. \"",

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. \nThis rank badge features a qilin, representing a first rank military official. The mythical creature is engulfed in flames. It is perched on a scholar's rock, which are particularly-shaped rocks appreciated by the literati and found in Chinese gardens. This badge is crafted with embroidery using silk floss, peacock feather, and metal-wrapped thread.",

        "Description": "Two silk tapestry weave sleeve bands that have been attached to a thick brocade border and lining, possibly to recreate them into decorative objects. Each sleeve band has a mirrored scene of five children - all boys - playing in a garden amongst peonies, peaches, trees, and rocks. The children are dressed in garments that were popular for youth in the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). A boy near the top of the band holds a conch shell, which is an auspicious Buddhist symbol. Although the bands are woven in kesi, details have been added with painted ink, including colour gradients in the flowers and children's clothing. Sleeve bands are the wide decorated cuffs attached to women's robes and jackets, often made and sold separately from the rest of the garment. They became important commercial objects in the Qing Dynasty as they are modular accessories that could be purchased in a market and attached to the garment at home.",

        "Description": "The subject for this work comes from the Noh play, Hagoromo “Feathered Robe”, which is based on a legend about a heavenly maiden. \n\nThe maiden descends from heaven to bathe in the beautiful waters of Mio Inlet. While she is bathing, she hangs her feathered robe on the branches of a pine tree where it is found by a fisherman. At first, the fisherman refuses to return her robe, but he is finally moved by her tearful entreaties. Without her robe, she will be unable to return to heaven and will wither away.  He asks her to dance for him if he returns her robe, to which request she happily agrees. She dons the robe, dances for him and then flies away to heaven at the end of the piece.  \nKataoka has taken two excerpts from the play for this work. The text in large Chinese characters on the blue paper on the right panel is an invocation of the Bodhisattva Daiseishi who is associated with the moon. The artist has done this section with a large brush emulating the calligraphic style of the Tang Dynasty master, Yan Zenqing (709 - 784.)\n\nThe two sheets on the left panel are excerpts from the last section of the play. Together, they comprise the climax of the play.",

        "Description": "A technique known as kurinuki shitate has been used to insert the papers into the framing fabric. If the papers were merely glued onto the backing fabric, it would be impossible to roll the scroll without creating wrinkles in the paper. The framing fabric for this work is the rarest material used in the Kataoka Calligraphy collection. It is donsu, damask silk, on which mother-of-pearl powder from blue seashells has been applied to the woven floral pattern to provide a subtle iridescence. The donsu silk already shifts in hue in accordance with the viewer’s point of view and source of light, but the addition of the mother-of-pearl makes this shifting in hue more dramatic. The cutting of such precious cloth to insert the paper takes a sure, practiced hand. A further subtle accent to this work is a thin border of red silk around each of the papers.\n\nKataoka has a deep affection for the earliest anthology of Japanese poetry, the Manyōshū (compiled c. 750). When she was searching its pages for a subject for this scroll, she was pleased to come upon a poem that mentions the Takamado district in Nara from which Prince Takamado’s name is derived. Since she was creating the work for an exhibition at the Prince Takamado Japan Center for Teaching and Research, an underlying theme for which was the remembrance of Prince Takamado, she felt this poem was especially appropriate. The poems of the Manyōshū were recorded before an efficient script for transcribing the Japanese language had been developed. The script used in the 8th C. is known as manyōgana, so named for its use in the transcription of the Manyōshū. It employs Chinese characters sometimes for meaning and sometimes for sound. Thus, it looks entirely like Chinese but is unreadable as Chinese. Kataoka rendered the manyōgana here in a lightly cursive, “running” style.",

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges. \nThis rank badge features a golden pheasant, representing a second-rank civil official. It is perched on a rock and gazing at a sun disc in the top left corner. Surrounding the birds in this badge are clouds and waves. This badge is embroidered with gold and silver metal-wrapped thread and details rendered in multi-coloured silk floss.",

        "Description": "A brown silk twill robe embroidered with many multi-coloured butterflies, rendered in smooth satin stitches of multi-coloured silk floss. Wide sleeves end in a faux folded cuff exposing a white silk sleeve lining embroidered with a blue floral motif. The cuffs, neckline, and two side vents are edged with black silk twill trim embroidered with a blue floral motif. These trims are also accompanied by commercial silk ribbons with geometric designs. Ruyi, an auspicious wish-granting symbol, sit atop either side vent and are further accentuated by the aforementioned commercial ribbons. The robe is lined with a bright blue silk damask with a floral pattern. This type of robe, referred to as a changyi, is a type of informal garment for a Manchu woman. This garment, with long side slits, would have been worn over a full-length underdress to preserve modesty. The \"one hundred\" butterflies motif was especially popular among older women, as the homophonous translation of \"butterflies\" (蝴蝶 or húdié) means 80 or 90 years old and represents longevity.",

        "Description": "Pine charcoal ink was used for this work, in contrast to the oil soot based ink that was used in all the other works. Pine charcoal based ink gives a broader range of “colour” than the soot based ink including a bluish hue when it is used in a pale concentrations, as in this work. The work has been framed with a wide border that slopes in, creating a deep recess over which the work is raised to give a “floating” effect. The frame is of dark brown stained horse chestnut wood.\n\nThis work demonstrates a modern expressive treatment of a single Chinese character. The use of pale ink for the rendering of Chinese characters is a special feature of modern calligraphy. The silk creates a “bleeding out” effect on the lines and the pine charcoal ink yields different colours in pale concentrations, all of which assist the desired effect for this piece by the artist. The character is “radiance” and it is written in a cursive style to suggest the scintillation of light.",

        "Description": "Yu Fei’an (original name Yu Kuizhao) was a prominent Chinese painter and calligrapher. Although he began his career as a journalist, he later shifted his focus to painting and calligraphy. Yu specialized in painting flowers and birds in the gongbi style, which emphasizes clearly defining details in a realistic manner. He extensively studied and replicated ancient masterpieces in the Palace Museum, with a particular emphasis on the works from the Song emperor Huizong's collection, which helped shape his unique style in drawing refined and sophisticated bird-and-flower paintings. Yu utilized fine, pointed brushes to create highly detailed depictions of petals, leaves, feathers, and other natural elements, often creating vivid and vibrant images of flowers and birds. His books on the use of colour in Chinese painting in the gongbi technique have been highly regarded and are significant contributions for they provided valuable references to the field of gongbi bird-and-flower painting.",

        "Description": "A brown silk gauze semi-formal court robe (jifu) for a man, likely the emperor based on the included Twelve Symbols of Imperial Authority. This robe has a nine-dragon pattern, with three five-clawed dragons on the front and back, one on either shoulder, and one hidden dragon under the front flap. The gauze on the robe is embroidered with metal-wrapped threads and multicoloured silk floss using a counted stitch technique, which continues on the trim around the collar and horse-hoof cuffs. There are open slits on the front, back, and two sides of the robe. The Twelve Symbols of Imperial Authority, which demonstrate the emperor's divine right to rule, can be found interspersed throughout the front, back, and shoulders of the robe. The sun, moon, and stars reflect the emperor’s constant shining over his territory and people. The mountains reflect the emperor's stable nature, the dragons illustrate his marvelous character, the pheasant represents literary ability, the cups, which are decorated with monkeys, symbolize faithfulness and respect, the seaweed represents a clean mind, the flames symbolize brightness, the axe reveals strong resolve, the fu character symbolizes a discerning mind, and the grain represents his ability to feed his people. The placement of these Twelve Symbols on a garment varied according to the costume regulations implemented by authorities. In the Qing dynasty (1644–1911), only the emperor and his heir could wear the complete set of twelve symbols. The sun, moon, stars, mountains, dragons, pheasant, axe, and fu symbols were placed at the top of the robe; the cups, flames, seaweed, and grain decorate the lower area of the robe. This robe also has a typical standing wave pattern at the hem, with crashing waves and mountains above. Alongside the dragons and Twelve Symbols, the sky portion of the robe has curly, sinuous clouds and various auspicious Buddhist symbols.",

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This badge is considered incomplete, as there is no bird or beast in the design. Surrounding the central blank space are clouds set against a dark background, with a scholar’s rock and wave-like pattern at the bottom.",

The  pink and purple peonies that surround the birds represent wealth, honour, and good fortune. In the upper portion of the table frontal there are peaches, a crane and the roof of a building. The background and borders are woven with scintillating gold-wrapped thread, which adds luxury to this textile. The border also includes a phoenix and lotus flower motif.",

        "Description": "A court necklace (chaozhu) with red glass beads (imitating coral), large jadeite beads, green glass beads, and glass pendants. Two strands of glass beads hang off the right side of the necklace, while the single strand hangs off the left. Each of these strands contains two groups of five beads on a silk cord and end in a blue-purple glass pendant with a small white bead and gold connector. A flat blue silk cord with wan symbols and blue glass pendants hangs down the back of the wearer's neck as a counterweight. This counterweight strand is connected to the rest of the necklace by a jade-coloured glass bead. Near this bead, the necklace cord is wrapped with white, purple and blue silk thread and has two white circular connectors with four holes. Court necklaces have 108 beads divided into four sets of 27 beads, which are separated by large Buddha beads (futou) (Vollmer, Dressed to Rule, p. 52). This necklace, however, only contains 100 red beads, which means it may not be an official court necklace. The Huangchao liqi tushi album (2004.19.1.1.9) demonstrates how high ranking female members of the imperial court wore three court necklaces (two criss-crossed around her torso and one around her neck), with specific materials for each rank.",

        "Description": "Yang Shanshen was a prominent Chinese painter and a leading member of the Lingnan School of Painting. After studying art in Japan at Domoto Art Institute from 1935-1938, Yang moved to Macau in 1941 and established the Xieshe Art Society with Gao Jianfu and Feng Kanghou. Xieshe Art Society sought to modernize traditional Chinese painting by incorporating techniques and ideas from Western art while emphasizing local landscapes, people, and customs. He was known for his use of a technique called \"splashed ink,\" in which he would splatter ink onto the paper to create abstract patterns and textures. Also, Yang's works were characterized by soft, delicate brushwork and a muted colour palette. which helped him to establish a distinct style in the Chinese art world. In 1970, he founded the Chunfeng Painting Society to teach painting and received an honorary degree from the Chinese Academic Research Institute in Taiwan. Yang's contributions to the arts were recognized by the Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region) Government, which awarded him the silver medal \"Bauhinia Star\" and the Guangzhou municipality Government, which declared him an Honorary Citizen of Guangzhou. Yang's artistic legacy continues to inspire contemporary artists in China and beyond.",

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. \nThis rank badge features a peacock, representing a third rank civil official. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges. It is perched on a rock and gazing at a sun disc in the top left corner. The eight Buddhist treasures are scattered throughout the design, including a parasol, endless knot, lotus blossom, victory banner, wheel, vase, carp, and conch shell. This badge is woven in tapestry, with a ground made from gold metal-wrapped thread and details rendered in multi-coloured silk floss. Ink is used for details and outlines.",

This sleeve band mirrors the scene of its partner, which depicts five children - all boys - playing in a garden amongst peonies, peaches, trees, and rocks. The children are dressed in garments that were popular for youth in the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). A boy near the top of the band holds a conch shell, which is an auspicious Buddhist symbol. Although this band is woven in kesi, details have been added with painted ink, including colour gradients in the flowers and children's clothing. Sleeve bands are the wide decorated cuffs attached to women's robes and jackets, often made and sold separately from the rest of the garment. They became important commercial objects in the Qing Dynasty as they are modular accessories that could be purchased in a market and attached to the garment at home.",

It contains 67 leaves consisting of 36 finely detailed colour paintings, 27 pages of descriptive text written on silk, and two double-width leaves bearing official court seals. According to the seals, the album was once in the Yuanming Yuan collection owned by the Qianlong Emperor (1711-1799).\nThese album leaves are part of a section of the illustrations of costumes from the Qianlong court, Huangchao liqi tushi (“The Regulations for the Ceremonial Paraphernalia of the [Qing] Dynasty”). Qianlong Emperor commissioned Prince Yunlu (1695-1767) to lead the editorial team, including scholar-officials and painters, in compiling the final regulations, which were published in 1759. Aside from costumes, Huangchao liqi tushi also includes descriptive texts and colourful illustrations of the instruments and devices used in imperial rituals.",

        "Description": "Lai Shaoqi, hailing from Puning, Guangdong province, is renowned for his woodblock prints and paintings. He began studying woodcutting techniques after receiving his degree from the Guangzhou Academy of Fine Arts in 1936. He later became a prominent member of the New Woodcut Movement, which was initiated by the renowned writer and scholar Lu Xun, during the 1930s and 1940s. Lai received guidance and encouragement from Lu Xun, who also introduced his works to the \"Complete World Art\" (世界美術全集) published in Japan in 1936, as well as to the Soviet Union, France, and England. Lu Xun praised Lai Shaoqi and his peers as \"the most combatant young woodcutters.” Lai's woodblock prints typically feature landscapes and natural scenes, with an emphasis on the interplay of light and shadow. Furthermore, he has produced prints that depict various cultural and historical events that reflect the theme of the War of Resistance, which was the prolonged conflict between China and Japan that began with the Marco Polo Bridge Incident in 1937 and culminated in Japan's capitulation in 1945.",

        "Description": "Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a bear embroidered in gold metal-wrapped and multicoloured silk floss, which represents a fifth rank military official. Bears and lions are often confused on rank badges, as the bear has a mane and tail that appears similar to a lion's. However, a bear's tail curls only at the base, whereas a lion's tail curls at the base and tip. A lion also has a curly mane, while a bear's mane hangs in straight tendrils. \nThe front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. The sun on the right side of these badges indicates that the wearer was female, likely the spouse of a military official. The bear, positioned at the center of the badge, is surrounded by flames, clouds, rocks, and standing water waves. A flaming wheel, a Buddhist symbol, can be seen amongst the waves with other obscured treasures. There are bats throughout the sky, which are a symbol of good luck. Many flowers are embroidered in the background, including peonies. Gold metal-wrapped threads outline auspicious symbols and also make up the geometric border design.",

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. \nThis rank badge displays a mandarin duck, representing a seventh rank civil official. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges. Early Qing badges used gold-wrapped thread embroidered in dense rows, carefully outlining each motif until the background was completely filled. The bird is perched on a scholar's rock, which is a particularly-shaped rock appreciated by the literati and found in Chinese gardens. The rock is stitched with peacock-feather twisted thread.",

The front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a crane, which is identified by its red crown and white feathers. The crane is standing on a rock amidst multi-coloured waves, pink peonies, trees, and clouds. The motifs on these badges, which are identical for the front and back, have been rendered in tapestry weave with a brilliant gold background. The sun on the left side of these badges indicates that the wearer was male.",

This type of purse is a da lian, or money purse, and it would have been attached to a belt worn around a man's waist. As mens garments did not have pockets, they kept all of their everyday essentials, including fan cases, spectacle cases, tobacco pouch, watch purse, brush holder, and a case for visiting cards on these belts. The praying mantis, tang lang, relates to a house full of treasures and represents wealth or fortune.",

The calligraphy was crafted by Cuo Wen (also known as Liu Taixi), a close friend of Zhou Maifu, who was invited to inscribe these poems in the album.",

Each leaf contains a landscape, which was painted in situby Wang Gai. Repeating themes throughout the album include figures immersed in the natural environment, which reflects the literati’s yearning and nostalgia.\nIn this scene, a man looks out of one of  five cottages, which are surrounded by mountains and a lake. There is a waterfall in the distance and a boat docked by the cottages.",

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges. \nThis rank badge features a golden pheasant, representing a second-rank civil official. It is perched on a rock and gazing at a sun disc in the top left corner. Surrounding the birds in this badge are clouds and waves. This badge is made with gold and silver metal-wrapped thread and details rendered in multi-coloured silk floss.",

        "Description": "Using a combination of rough, thick brush sketches and coloured ink, the painting Fishing Village by Wu Guanzhong (1919-2010) depicts the seaside view of Shitang - located in the eastern part of Zhejiang province. The foreground is dominated by geometrically-shaped residential houses, which accurately capture the characteristics of white-walled and black-tiled Jiangnan style residential buildings. The background, mainly delineated by curvilinear lines, presents the ebb and flow of the sea. In the upper right corner of the painting, Wu Guanzhong wrote, “Ten days in the fishing village reminiscing about Shitang, busy with work all day and night, the islanders have no time to enjoy the sea waves.” This suggests the overall nostalgic tone of the painting – the artist’s longing for Shitang.",

        "Description": "An album of 48 ink and watercolour drawings bound in blue silk-covered boards with silk ties. The drawings are done on laid paper, which have then been individually adhered into the album. Figures in the album include government officials, ordinary people, figures demonstrating local customs, methods of transportation, and individuals receiving punishment. This album, likely made for trade export, would have been painted and compiled by a European artist in China. As Westerners became more interested in Qing-era fashion, customs, flora, fauna and other minutiae of daily life, items such as this album and the Insect Album (2004.19.3) were in high demand in Europe. Clues that this album may have been painted by a Western artist include the English titles, the subtle but expressive faces of the figures, and the incorrect details in some of the drawings.",

        "Description": "This poem was written in 1912 when Yosano Akiko was on her way to meet her husband in Paris. She had sent him to Europe to help him overcome depression, but then could not bear to be separated from him, and made the trip all alone on the Trans-Siberian Railway to rejoin him. This poem describes her feelings as the train was approaching Paris through fields of red poppies. \n\nKataoka's calligraphic rendering of the poem is very free, like the spirit of the poet herself. The composition is split into two sections, one grouping of five lines in the upper half of the paper and a second grouping of six lines in the lower half. As was the custom in the early 20th Century, the artist has used Chinese characters to transcribe the word “France” rather than using katakana. The repeated word kokuriko is a phonetic transcription of the French word for poppy, coquelicot. \n\nIn the album format, the poem facing this one is on red paper. Kataoka did not want to use red again, feeling that putting a poem about red poppies on red paper was too simplistic. Instead, she wanted the viewer to feel the red of the poppies vibrating in the neighboring poem and chose a soft gold paper for the Yosano Akiko poem to suggest the richness of her feeling.",

The man in the cart sits atop luggage and wears an official’s hat with red tassels over his long, queue braid, which was a regulated hairstyle for men in the Qing dynasty. He also holds onto an open parasol. The two men operating the cart wear straw hats, tunics, and pants tucked into tall boots. The man on the right appears to be pulling the cart, while the man in the rear steers or pushes the cart.",

        "Description": "Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. \nThis rank badge displays a mandarin duck, representing a seventh rank civil official. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges. Early Qing badges used gold-wrapped thread embroidered in dense rows, carefully outlining each motif until the background was completely filled. The bird is perched on a scholar's rock, which is a particularly-shaped rock appreciated by the literati and found in Chinese gardens. The rock is stitched with peacock-feather twisted thread.",

The robe is thick and has a batting-lined collar suggesting the owner might use it in cold weather in Tibet. The pattern on the Chinese brocade of the robe features dragons, clouds, rocks, and waves, displaying a Qing imperial design. \nThe robe is thick and heavy and reveals the fabric belongs to an early Qing style. Crowded cloud patterns accumulate all over the robe. Eight gold brocaded dragons are upon the clouds, including four front-facing dragons on the top section (chest, back and shoulders) and four side-facing dragons on the lower section (front and back). Below the dragons, there are large curled waves, rocks in the middle and colourful striped waters along the hem.",

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a silver pheasant representing the fifth rank of a civil official. This bird is identified by its white feathers, white crown with a red stripe and long tail.\nThe front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. This rank badge pair was decorated with delicate seed stitches, also referred to as “Peking knots” or ta tzu. Gold metal-wrapped thread is couched around some of the colourful motifs as a border. In the centre of the badge, a silver pheasant, standing on rocks above waves, looks toward a red sun in the upper left corner. An embellished canopy floats above the bird, while the Eight Buddhist treasures surround it, including lotuses, the wheel, the parasol, the vase, the conch, the fish and the endless knot. The border of the badge is decorated with blue and white floral motifs and gold geometric patterns.",

Yu has utilized extremely fine brushwork to portray the detailed features of the doves’ heads, wings, tails, and claws, which brings the birds to life against the flat background.",

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. \nThis pair of rank badges features a xiezhi, a mythical creature with a goat- or ox-like body and a single horn on its head. It is gazing at the sun disk in the upper left corner. Renowned for distinguishing right from wrong, the xiezhi attacks the wicked, serving as a powerful symbol of justice. In the imperial court, it represented the role of the imperial censor, tasked with overseeing the ethical behaviour of officials.",

The robe opens on the wearer's right side and is fastened with small brass buttons. The pattern design on the robe consists of nine dragons, clouds, and auspicious emblems, as well as rocks, curling wave caps and diagonally-striped waves along the hem.\nThis blue dragon robe is embroidered using metallic threads for the dragons and multi-coloured silk floss  for the rest of the patterns. The body of the robe is made of light silk gauze, which would be preferable for warm summer weather.",

The calligraphy contains four Tang poems, including one poem by Cen Shen (715-770) and three poems by Wang Wei (692-761).\nDong Qichang was a remarkable calligrapher, painter, and art theoretician in the late Ming dynasty. He was also a politician and distinguished connoisseur who greatly influenced Chinese aesthetic theory.",

Shi used a bird's-eye perspective to portray the landscape, which adds pictorial depth to this painting. In order to create depth and atmosphere, the ink brush strokes on the mountains in the foreground are much bolder, darker, and stronger than those in the back, which were created with more diluted ink. The flow of the river is suggested  with faint brushstrokes, which appear fragile against the white background. The artist’s name and seal, which is actually a red drawing by Shi Lu, are visible in the lower right corner of the painting.",

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. \nThis pair of rank badges features a wild goose, symbolizing a fourth rank civil official. Perched on a rock amid waves, the goose gazes toward the sun disc in the upper right corner. Ruyi-shaped clouds and bats decorate the sky. The badge is woven in tapestry (kesi), and ink was used for details and colour gradation.",

He did and prospered. Then he became curious about one customer who came in everyday. When Kōfū questioned the customer about his origin, the man confessed that he was actually a shōjō, a kind of water sprite dwelling in the waters of the Yangzi River. Kōfū went down to the river one moonlit night with a cask of wine and waited for his friend to appear in his true form. The sprite arrived to drink a chrysanthemum wine with him and dance over the waves.\n\n\"My name is Kōfū; I am a citizen of this village by the Yangzi at the foot of Gold Mountain in Cathay. Now, thanks to the filial love I have shown my parents, one night I saw a marvelous dream...\"\n\n\"We will never grow old. The name of this medicine is chrysanthemum wine. The wine cup floats out on the waves; meeting this friend fills me with joy.\"\n\n(Source: exhibition catalogue for \"Immortal Beauty: A Calligraphy Exhibition by Shikō Kataoka\", co-organized by University of Alberta Museums & Prince Takamado Japan Centre for Teaching and Research, University of Alberta, translation by Prof. Sonja Arntzen)",

        "Description": "Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. \nThis rank badge features a quail, representing an eighth rank civil official. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges. This bird is perched on a rock and gazing at a sun disc in the top left corner. This badge is woven in tapestry, with gold metal-wrapped thread and details rendered in multi-coloured silk floss. Coloured ink was used for colour gradation.",

        "Description": "The painting is associated with the poem (2004.19.38.10). It captures a tranquil winter scene, featuring a lone figure walking beneath a blossoming plum. The figure, shown from behind, is cloaked in a red robe and carries a walking staff. A large tree trunk stretching from the left side has wide-reaching branches covered in delicate white blossoms, painted with gentle, dappled brushstrokes. The white specks could represent either falling snow or plum blossoms. In either case, they are dense enough to weigh down the branches, causing them to bend and touch the ground.\nThe inscription in the bottom left corner reads, “Ren Yi, also known as Ren Bonian from Shanyin [山陰仁颐伯年],” and the red seal belongs to Ren Yi.",

        "Description": "This red silk robe features eight multicoloured embroidered roundels on the front, back, and shoulders. Each of the embroidered roundels contains a swirling pattern of peonies and butterflies, and brightly coloured with synthetic aniline dyes, which were introduced to China from Europe at the end of the nineteenth century. Peonies, the “king of flowers” in Chinese culture, were a popular motif in the Qing Dynasty and could be found on garments, furnishings, paintings, and other material culture. The two butterflies at the center of each roundel may represent a harmonious couple, referred to as the “butterfly lovers” in an ancient Chinese romantic legend\nThe wide sleeves on this robe have horse-hoof shaped cuffs that mimic those found on dragon robes during the Manchu reign of the Qing Dynasty. The rocks, waves, and standing water motifs found above the hem of this robe also reference the earlier robes of the imperial court. Auspicious symbols, including those from Buddhism, can be found amongst the rocks, including dragons, wan characters, canopies, the flaming wheel of the law, lotus flowers, and the endless knot. This robe was likely worn by a woman on her wedding day, based on the symbols for longevity and lucky red colour of the ground fabric, which symbolizes fertility and love.",

Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges.\nThis pair of Ming-era rank badges features a pair of peacocks, representing a third-rank civil official. Surrounding the birds in this badge are peonies and clouds. These badges were woven in tapestry, with a ground made from gold-wrapped thread and details rendered in multi-coloured silk floss.",

        "Description": "The painting is associated with the poem (2004.19.38.14). It depicts a man and a young attendant standing on a riverbank path. The man, dressed in traditional robes, has his hands clasped behind his back and leans slightly forward. The young attendant appears to be holding a musical instrument wrapped in a yellow cover.\nTo the left of the figures, a slender tree with thin branches extends upward, its leaves painted in warm orange hues, possibly reflecting the colors cast by the sunset. The background is dominated by the calm river, depicted in faint ink strokes. \nThe composition is balanced with foliage in the foreground, depicted in detailed brushwork, contrasting the simplicity of the river and sky. The color palette is muted, with earth tones and soft grays dominating the figures’ robes, while the touch of red in the leaves adds a hint of vibrancy. \nOn the left, Ren Yi wrote the “Seal of Bonian [伯年 印]” along with his red personal seal.",

It contains 67 leaves consisting of 36 finely detailed colour paintings, 27 pages of descriptive text written on silk, and two double-width leaves bearing official court seals. According to the seals, the album was once in the Yuanming Yuan collection owned by the Qianlong Emperor (1711-1799). These album leaves are part of a section of the illustrations of costumes from the Qianlong court, Huangchao liqi tushi (“The Regulations for the Ceremonial Paraphernalia of the [Qing] Dynasty”). Qianlong Emperor commissioned Prince Yunlu (1695-1767) to lead the editorial team, including scholar-officials and painters, in compiling the final regulations, which were published in 1759. Aside from costumes, Huangchao liqi tushi also includes descriptive texts and colourful illustrations of the instruments and devices used in imperial rituals.",

        "Description": "Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a silver pheasant representing the fifth rank of a civil official. This bird is identified by its white feathers, white crown with a red stripe and long tail.\nThe front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. This rank badge pair was decorated with smooth satin stitches surrounded by couched metal-wrapped threads. Bats (which represent fortune) and auspicious motifs are scattered among coin-shaped clouds. The background is filled with green geometric lines and  wan symbols (similar in form, but not ideology, to a swastika), which symbolize infinity. In the centre of the badge is a silver pheasant standing on rocks above the waves and water, looking toward a red sun in the upper right corner. The position of the sun on the right side of the badge indicates that the badge was used by the spouse of a civil official and decorated with her husband’s rank.",

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a bear embroidered in gold metal-wrapped and multicoloured silk floss, which represents a fifth rank military official. Bears and lions are often confused on rank badges, as the bear has a mane and tail that appears similar to a lion's. However, a bear's tail curls only at the base, whereas a lion's tail curls at the base and tip. A lion also has a curly mane, while a bear's mane hangs in straight tendrils. \nThe front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. The sun on the right side of these badges indicates that the wearer was female, likely the spouse of a military official. The bear, positioned at the center of the badge, is surrounded by flames, clouds, rocks, and standing water waves. A flaming wheel, a Buddhist symbol, can be seen amongst the waves with other obscured treasures. There are bats throughout the sky, which are a symbol of good luck. Many flowers are embroidered in the background, including peonies. Gold metal-wrapped threads outline auspicious symbols and also make up the geometric border design.",

        "Brief Bio": "Chinese, born 1919",
        "Nationality": "Chinese",
        "Description": "Wu Guanzhong was a prominent contemporary Chinese artist. While Wu Guanzhong is best known for his exceptional fusion of traditional Chinese ink painting techniques with Western artistic styles, he also created simple yet powerful abstract forms in some of his works. These forms often reflect his unique perspective on landscapes and natural scenes, resulting in a captivating blend of realism and abstraction in his paintings. He enrolled at the National Arts Academy of Hangzhou in 1936, where he received instruction in both modern Western art and traditional Chinese painting from Lin Fengmian and Pan Tianshou. Wu's artistic repertoire comprises landscapes, cityscapes, and everyday scenes, where he incorporates elements of traditional Chinese ink painting and Western art movements such as Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, and Fauvism. In 1947, Wu received a government scholarship to study at École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, France. Upon his return to China, he joined the faculty of the Central Academy of Art in 1950, teaching watercolor and drawing in the Department of Architecture at Qinghua University before moving to Beijing Normal University (later Beijing Fine Arts Normal College) to teach art in 1956. During his tenure, he created numerous works inspired by the natural beauty of different Chinese regions. Wu received several awards and accolades, including being named Officier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Ministry of Culture in 1991 and appointed as an academician of the Académie des Beaux-Arts in 2002.",

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. \nThis rank badge features a flycatcher, representing a ninth rank civil official. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird was seen on rank badges. The flycatcher is surrounded by ruyi-shaped clouds and four bats, with its wings spread wide and gaze directed toward the sun disk in the upper left corner. This badge is embroidered with gold-metal wrapped thread and silk floss using counted stitches on silk gauze.",

However, adults tend to be poor dispersers (Britten et al., 1995).

This leaf contains an ink and watercolour full-length portrait of a high ranking civil officer. His high rank can be determined by his hat, with ruby red finial and double-eyed peacock feather, as well as his rank badge with a crane, which indicates that he is a first rank civil official. He wears a mid-length black surcoat over a dragon robe, which has long sleeves with horse-hoof cuffs. He also wears a court necklace and black boots, which are a typical part of an official’s outfit.",

This leaf contains an ink and watercolour depiction of ankle crusher torture, or jiagun, which utilized three wooden boards and a length of cord that was gradually pulled to increase the pressure on the prisoner's ankle bones. This was a non-lethal form of punishment that was used to elicit a confession from the prisoner. In this scene, a man, dressed in a blue tunic and short pants, lays prone on a wooden plank with his ankles between three long skinny boards. Four men in mid-length black jackets, blue pants, and hats with feathers surround the prisoner. One holds his shoulders down, two pull on a long cord, and the fourth uses a mallet to strike the boars, breaking the prisoner’s bones and causing immense pain.",

The short standing collar, combined with vibrant colours from synthetic aniline dyes, indicates that this robe was made in the late 19th or early 20th century.",

Though the lines and colours are simplistic, the painting is carefully composed. Wang emphasizes structure and faithfully depicts the contours of the figure. While he uses only a few strokes to outline, the expressions accurately convey the subject’s inner life and character. For instance, we can tell from his attire that Qi Baishi was a very traditional man, and we seem to feel his insightful gaze penetrating through his lenses. Wang’s use of lines is quite distinctive, and has a certain degree of calligraphic charm.",
        "Inscriptions and Colophons": "Signed by Ziwu and impressed with 2 artist seals.  The scroll is also inscribed with 2 poems by Qi Baishi.",

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a silver pheasant representing the fifth rank of a civil official. This bird is identified by its white feathers, white crown with a red stripe and long tail.\nThe front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. This rank badge pair was decorated with delicate seed stitches, also referred to as “Peking knots” or ta tzu. Gold metal-wrapped thread is couched around some of the colourful motifs as a border. In the centre of the badge, a silver pheasant, standing on rocks above waves, looks toward a red sun in the upper left corner. An embellished canopy floats above the bird, while the Eight Buddhist treasures surround it, including lotuses, the wheel, the parasol, the vase, the conch, the fish and the endless knot. The border of the badge is decorated with blue and white floral motifs and gold geometric patterns.",

        "Description": "This hanging scroll by Yang Shanshen (1913 - 2004), a renowned Chinese painter of the 20th century, depicts three small sparrows perched on a bamboo tree set against an unpainted background. Yang's distinctive style is characterized by his use of the baimiao technique, a traditional Chinese ink painting method where only the black outlines of the subjects are painted, leaving the unfilled spaces to convey the essence of the painting. In Bamboo and Sparrows, Yang's use of the baimiao technique results in a minimalistic bamboo tree, emphasizing the simplicity and elegance of its natural form. However, the sparrows are painted with a different technique, the mogu or \"boneless\" style, which utilizes diluted colourful ink washes to create soft and delicate textures that evoke the feather texture of the birds. Yang's masterful use of both the baimiao and mogu techniques creates a harmonious contrast between the precise and rough lines of the bamboo and the smooth and fluid ink washes of the sparrows. The composition of the painting is also carefully balanced, with the three sparrows arranged in a triangular formation, creating a dynamic and lively scene.",
        "Inscriptions and Colophons": "The scroll is signed by Yang Shanshen and is impressed with 2 artist seals.  The scroll is also inscribed with a poem from the Tang dynasty.",

The fabric of the robe is splendid, with a gold thread background and colourful patterns. The design features four dragons in purple, green, red, and blue colours placed on the robe's front, back and shoulders. These five-clawed dragons seem to playfully frolic among lotuses, peonies, chrysanthemums and other flowers. Rocks, waves and clouds decorate the bottom of the robe, near the hem. Among these rocks are auspicious motifs, including two persimmons in a bottle, coloured pearls, gold bullion bars and other items.\nThe design of the fabric reflects the influence of the Chinese imperial style, yet it was not initially made for a robe in China; it was made for a wall hanging. The Tibetan owner made the fabric into a chuba to fit his needs.",

There is a crane, recognizable by the red cap on its head, on the square rank badges, which identifes the wearer as a first-rank civil official. The position of the sun on the left side of the badge (the wearer's right side) indicates that the wearer is a man. Clouds surround the crane, as well as bats, which symbolize good fortune. An ascending and descending dragon can be found in each medallion in the ground of the surcoat. This surcoat has a typical front opening with five brass buttons, and three vents - two at the sides and one in the back. Garments like this were used to represent the wearer's identity to the broader society and, as such, it would have been worn as an outer garment over robes, as seen in the Family Portrait painting (2007.23.1). Consorts and children often wore badges that declared the patriarch's rank as well.",

The ink and watercolour drawing on this leaf depicts a man sitting in a sedan chair being carried by two men. The sedan chair consists of two long poles, which sit on the shoulders of the porters, with a seat and a footrest for the passenger. The passenger is dressed like a typical Manchu man, in a mid-length blue robe with a “queue” hairstyle, in which the front and sides of his head are shaved with a long braid down the back. The passenger also holds an umbrella and has luggage secured behind his back. The two porters are wearing short blue tunics over short white pats with straw hats and sandals.",

        "Description": "Wang Ziwu was a Chinese painter renowned for his figure portraits. He graduated from the Xi’an Fine Art Academy in 1963 and subsequently became an active member of the China Artists Association (CAA). Wang Ziwu focused on studying the painting techniques of Qi Baishi, Huang Binhong, and Pan Tianshou from 1966 and copied the works of Russian realistic artists like Lebin and Vasily Surikov. Combining these artistic influences, he developed an innovative style in ink and wash painting that emphasized highly-idealized figures and an accurate, detailed, unembellished depiction of portraits. Wang Ziwu paid meticulous attention to details and sought to capture the essence of his subjects in his portraits. He became the director of the research department of the CAA's Shaanxi Branch in 1978, where he continued to create many remarkable works of art throughout the 1970s and 1980s. His paintings were featured in catalogs published during this period, solidifying his reputation as a significant figure in Chinese painting.",

        "Description": "Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This rank badge, separated from its front panel, features a pair of silver pheasants, representing a fifth-ranked civil official. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges. Surrounding the birds in this badge are peonies, cherry blossoms, and clouds. The lower bird is perched on a scholar's rock, which are particularly-shaped rocks appreciated by the literati and found in Chinese gardens. This badge is woven in tapestry (kesi), with a ground made from gold-wrapped thread and details rendered in multi-coloured silk floss.",

This surcoat has a typical front opening with five brass buttons, and three vents - two at the sides and one in the back.

The location is probably in Jinshansi, the Gold Mountain Buddhist temple in Zhenjiang. Inside the stone walls of the complex, an antiques market bustles with activity. Officials wearing yellow robes and palace servants in tasseled court caps examine and purchase porcelain, paintings, and bronze antiquities. The Green Standard Banner of the imperial army is positioned just outside the walls of the temple complex, as if securing the space.\nThe gem-like color and fine brushwork has led some scholars to believe that this scroll may have been intended as a gift for one of the local officials who hosted the imperial entourage during their tour. Alternatively, other scholars believe this may have been a preparatory painting for compositions in other scrolls in the Southern Tour series, which no longer exist.",

        "Description": "The mounting style of this scroll is called maru hyōgu, “round mount” in which the outer framing fabric surrounds the whole work. [For contrast see the mounting of 2008.14.4.1, where three types of fabric are used and the middle surround cuts the scroll into three distinct sections.] The mounting has in addition, two horizontal strips called ichimonji, above and below the work. The backing fabric and horizontal strips are of donsu damask silk in two different floral patterns.\n\nSince the exhibition of Kataoka’s donated works was first held in April (2008), she though it appropriate to include one piece in a spring mood. This line from a Chinese poem by 8th C. poet Cen Can answers that need well. The whole piece including the small characters was written with a large brush. The calligraphy is spirited and bold. In traditional Chinese calligraphy, the mounting is generally made subordinate to the calligraphy work, whereas in Japanese calligraphy the mounting is often considered of equal importance in the creation of the aesthetic whole. Comparing this work with 2008.14.4.1 or with 2008.14.1.1-.2 will make this difference very clear. Here, Kataoka has followed the traditional Chinese practice. The paper is plain and the mounting is restrained. The floral pattern in the backing fabric complements the subject of the work in a quiet way.",

        "Definition": "Embroidery describes the surface decoration of a fabric using a needle to apply thread, yarns, or other materials, including metal-wrapped threads, small pearls and peacock feathers spun into yarns. Often considered… \n\n\nEmbroidery describes the surface decoration of a fabric using a needle to apply thread, yarns, or other materials, including metal-wrapped threads, small pearls and peacock feathers spun into yarns. Often considered a decorative art that represents the height of women’s handiwork, it was an essential part of high-ranking  young women’s education1. There are four main schools of embroidery: Shu embroidery (from Sichan), Xiang embroidery (from Hunan), Su embroidery (from Suzhou) and Yue (from Guangdong) embroidery. Accomplished embroiderers were considered artists in their own right.\n\n\n\nVarious stitches are made by hand to give a painterly quality to the surface design. Satin stitches in both long and short lengths create depth and movement in the embroidered design. Couching stitches are used to embroider metal-wrapped threads, as the thread would not be strong or flexible enough to go through the fabric. A second thread (a plain silk yarn with no metal foil) in a variety of colours is used to secure the metal-wrapped thread. Furthermore, the high cost of producing metal-wrapped threads meant that the maker would not want to obscure half of the thread length under the fabric surface, as would be the case with typical running stitches. Another frequently used embroidery stitch is the “Peking knot stitch” (also referred to as da zi, the “seed stitch”), in which the threaded needle enters the fabric from the back side, the thread is wrapped around itself three or four times, and the needle returns through the fabric. This stitch is often used to define details or act as a filler2. The patience and preciseness required to successfully execute this stitch required even tension, an exact placing of stitches, and may have caused severe eye strain to the skilled embroiderer.\n\nRelated Definitions:\n\nFiber: Natural (plant or animal) or synthetic material formed into a thread that is longer than it is wide.\n\nWarp: lengthwise yarn that runs from the top to the bottom of the fabric. This yarn is typically held stationary during weaving.\n\nWeft (or Fill or Filling Yarns): crosswise yarn that runs selvedge to selvedge, under and over the warp yarns in varying patterns to create different weave structures.\n\nYarn: A continuous length of interlocked fibers, which may or may not be twisted.\nPlain Weave (or Tabby Weave): the most basic weave structure that consists of one warp and one weft thread intersecting at a right angle. The front and backside of the resulting fabric are the same.\n\nSatin Weave: Four or more weft yarns intersecting with a warp yarn, or vice versa. The resulting floats, which are sections of the yarn that do not intersect, appear on the face of the fabric, producing a very glossy, smooth, and flat appearance.\n\nTwill Weave: one weft thread passing over one or more warp threads and then under two or more warp threads creating diagonal ridges, which are the identifying feature of the resulting fabric.\n\n1 Dieter Kuhn et al., Chinese Silks (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2012), 468.\n2 Young Yang Chung, The Art of Oriental Embroidery: History, Aesthetics, and Techniques (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1983), 37. \nRead More +",

        "Description": "A red tapestry weave robe with many gold and silver butterflies throughout. The cuffs, neckline, and two side vents are edged with  black tapestry weave borders with a similar butterfly motif. These borders are also edged by a narrow gold metal-wrapped thread and silk floss geometric brocade trim that has a repeating wan symbol (similar to the swastika in form, but not ideology), which has an auspicious meaning of “infinity” or “eternity”. Ruyi, an auspicious wish-granting symbol, sit atop either side vent and are further accentuated by the aforementioned commercial ribbons. The robe is lined with a light yellow plain weave silk. This type of informal robe with wide sleeves and side slits, referred to as a changyi, is a type of informal garment for a Manchu woman. The \"one hundred\" butterflies motif was especially popular among older women, as the homophonous translation of \"butterflies\" (蝶) means 80 or 90 years old and represents longevity.",

        "Nationality": "Chinese",
        "Description": "As an elite courtesan in the Ming Dynasty (1368 - 1644), Ma Shouzhen (1548 - 1604) was skilled in many fine arts, including poetry, reciting classical literature, dancing, singing, acting, calligraphy and painting. She was born in 1548 in Nanjing, which was known as Jinling at the time, and lived in the popular “pleasure district” along the Qinhuai River. Ma was also known by her style names Yuejiao, meaning “Lunar Beauty”, and  Xianglan, which means “Orchid of the Xiang River” and alludes to one of her favourite subjects to paint - orchids. Orchids were popular painting subjects in relation to courtesans as they represented something fragrant, delicate, and beautiful. Ma also frequently painted bamboo, narcissus, and other literati-approved foliage - which are references to the classical past, virtue and eroticism, but also grew readily in the temperate Jiangnan region. \n\nMa Shouzhen began painting around the age of 16 and many of her works were dedicated to her literati clients, including poet and calligrapher Wang Zhideng (1535 - 1612), with whom she had a long-term relationship. The literati, or scholar-officials, wanted to be surrounded by courtesans who were talented and proficient in their areas of interest, including art, prose, and poetry - and Ma’s paintings were in high demand. Courtesans of the Late Ming straddled the dichotomies of masculine and feminine, acting as an intermediary between classes and genders, and were producers and audiences of many different art forms.",

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts.  In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges.\nThis Ming-era rank badge features a pair of peacocks, representing a third-rank civil official. Surrounding the birds in this badge are peonies and clouds. This badge is woven in tapestry, with a ground made from gold-wrapped thread and details rendered in multi-coloured silk floss.",

        "Description": "With the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911, the rank badge system was abolished along with the end of the imperial bureaucracy. However, in 1916, Yuan Shikai attempted to restore the Qing Empire by declaring himself Emperor Hongxian. This pair of embroidered roundels, featuring the Twelve Symbols of Imperial Authority, serves as an example of his effort to invoke imperial imagery. There are nine motifs of the Twelve Symbols embroidered on the roundel, including a pair of cups, seaweed, fire, grain, an axe, a pheasant, a dragon, mountains and the fu character in the centre. Encircling the entire composition is a border of circular ruyi-shaped clouds.",

        "Description": "Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. \nThis rank badge displays a mandarin duck, representing a seventh rank civil official. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges. Early Qing badges used gold-wrapped thread embroidered in dense rows, carefully outlining each motif until the background was completely filled. The bird is perched on a scholar's rock, which is a particularly-shaped rock appreciated by the literati and found in Chinese gardens. The rock is stitched with peacock-feather twisted thread.",

However, in 1916, Yuan Shikai attempted to restore the Qing Empire by declaring himself Emperor Hongxian. This embroidered roundel, featuring the Twelve Symbols of Imperial Authority, serves as an example of his effort to invoke imperial imagery. There are nine motifs of the Twelve Symbols embroidered on the roundel, including a pair of cups, seaweed, fire, grain, an axe, a pheasant, a dragon, mountains and the fu character in the centre. Encircling the entire composition is a border of circular ruyi-shaped clouds.",

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. \nThis rank badge features an egret, representing a sixth rank civil official. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird was seen on rank badges. The egret in this badge is surrounded by ruyi-shaped clouds, with its wings outstretched and its gaze fixed on the sun disk in the upper left corner. This badge is woven in tapestry, with a ground made from metallic thread. Coloured ink was used to depict details in the bird’s body.",

It is only a little more than seven years from the end of the battles, in 1766, that the drawings of the conquests were finished. The painters needed this space of time in order to meticulously inquire into [what] the forms of the camps and battles [looked like] so as to compose their designs. Of the officers and soldiers who left for the campaigns and risked their lives at extreme odds, one out of a hundred survived. Giving their lives to the state ensured that their campaigns were successful, so how could I suggest that they die without recognition? That is why in the Throne Hall of the Purple Effulgent Pole Star (Ziguangge 紫光閣) we have had the portraits painted of those who distinguished themselves. And because of this motivation, we went to the bloody battlefields, we faithfully depicted the circumstances where attacks were made on our strongholds--where we broke the ardour of the enemy, beheaded the generals, and stole the flags--in order to pay homage to their efforts and to celebrate their courage. When I reviewed the military reports I dedicated some poems to them, and I rewrote them to be placed between the folios. For the six scenes that I have not yet touched with my brush [meaning he had yet inscribed them with poetry], I have dedicated special supplementary poems. When I hear the sound of the drums, then I think [I am reminded] of the generals and soldiers, who are our state. These paintings inspired the same feeling in me. Before the completion of these paintings, I constantly imagined myself touring the battleground even during my busy dealings of government affairs at court. Now with these paintings that show everything vividly before my eyes, I feel as if I am commanding the soldiers on the battlefield…\n\nSorrowfully inscribed by the Qianlong emperor in the spring of February-March, 1766\n\n transcribed by Wei Bingqing, translated by Lisa Claypool \nRead More +",

The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. \nThese rank badges feature a silver pheasant, representing a fifth rank civil official. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges. It is perched on a rock and gazing at a sun disc in the top right corner. The pattern on the badge is embroidered with fine seed stitches of multicoloured silk floss.

Both of these poems were included in the 13th C. Imperial poetry anthology, Shinkokinshū. This work foregrounds the aesthetics of kana calligraphy and in this respect is a good work to compare with 2008.14.5, which features Chinese calligraphy. The work displays a fine balance between the darkness and lightness of ink, thickness and thinness of line, as well as with the distribution of lines and space on the page.\n\nThe outer wooden frame is finished with red tamenuri lacquer.  This type of screen is called a sumitate byōbu, “screen for placing in a corner” but its relatively small dimension makes it appropriate for display in various parts of a room. Kataoka has placed the white paper panels at different levels to create variation in the work’s composition. A further subtlety in the framing of the work is to have the mounting fabric form a square on two corners and a rounded edge on the opposing corners. The metal corner fittings for the screen are sukiiri.",

Each leaf contains a landscape, which was painted in situ by Wang Gai. Repeating themes throughout the album include figures immersed in the natural environment, which reflects the literati’s yearning and nostalgia.\nIn this scene, two men are in a boat, with one sitting and the other rowing towards the landscape with an obscured building behind a large moss-covered rock. The surrounding landscape includes mountain ranges, flat plains and a bridge to the island.",

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. \nThis rank badge features a xiezhi, a mythical creature with a goat- or ox-like body and a single horn on its head. It is gazing at the sun disk in the upper left corner. Renowned for distinguishing right from wrong, the xiezhi attacks the wicked, serving as a powerful symbol of justice. In the imperial court, it represented the role of the imperial censor, tasked with overseeing the ethical behaviour of officials.",

Brocade is easily identified by the long floats on the backside of the fabric, which occur when the colourful weft yarns are not in use on the surface design. These floats make the fabric slightly thicker than other multi-coloured fabrics, such as tapestry. Brocade fabric can have a variety of ground fabrics, including twill, plain weave, leno, and satin. Brocade is woven on a complex loom (called a “drawloom”)  that is operated by two weavers: one on the top of the loom (“drawboy”) and a second craftsperson operating the lower section. \n\nRelated Definitions:\n\nFiber: Natural (plant or animal) or synthetic material formed into a thread that is longer than it is wide.\n\nWarp: lengthwise yarn that runs from the top to the bottom of the fabric. This yarn is typically held stationary during weaving.\n\nWeft (or Fill or Filling Yarns): crosswise yarn that runs selvedge to selvedge, under and over the warp yarns in varying patterns to create different weave structures.\n\nYarn: A continuous length of interlocked fibers, which may or may not be twisted.\nPlain Weave (or Tabby Weave): the most basic weave structure that consists of one warp and one weft thread intersecting at a right angle. The front and backside of the resulting fabric are the same.\n\nSatin Weave: Four or more weft yarns intersecting with a warp yarn, or vice versa. The resulting floats, which are sections of the yarn that do not intersect, appear on the face of the fabric, producing a very glossy, smooth, and flat appearance.\n\nTwill Weave: one weft thread passing over one or more warp threads and then under two or more warp threads creating diagonal ridges, which are the identifying feature of the resulting fabric.\n\nLeno: A type of gauze fabric in which two or more warp yarns (up to four) are twisted around a weft yarn to produce a strong but fine, loose, and open fabric. \nRead More +",

There are qilin along the hem and cuffs of the robe, as well as phoenixes along the lower torso and mid-sleeve. The upper torso is adorned with an ancient style of dragon called kuilong, which is a snake-like creature depicted in either a geometric or curvilinear style. In the background there are clouds, waves, rocks, peonies, and mountains. Brown fur trims the cuffs, front flap, and hem of the robe. These tapestry fragments in the robe were imported from China and can be dated to the 17th century or earlier.",

His body is slightly inclined forward as he turns his head toward the audience.\nThe jagged rock on the right is rendered with bold, expressive brushstrokes, providing a striking contrast to the delicate foliage. The palm trees behind the rock are painted with subtle, layered brushwork, creating a sense of movement and depth.\nThe inscription on the left states, “Written by Ren Yi, also known as Ren Bonian from Shanyin, in Chunshenpu (now the Huangpu River in Shanghai) [山陰任頤伯年寫于春申浦]”, and the red seal belongs to Ren Yi.",

        "Description": "Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a bear embroidered in gold metal-wrapped and multicoloured silk floss, which represents a fifth rank military official. Bears and lions are often confused on rank badges, as the bear has a mane and tail that appears similar to a lion's. However, a bear's tail curls only at the base, whereas a lion's tail curls at the base and tip. A lion also has a curly mane, while a bear's mane hangs in straight tendrils. \nThe front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. The sun on the right side of these badges indicates that the wearer was female, likely the spouse of a military official. The bear, positioned at the center of the badge, is surrounded by flames, clouds, rocks, and standing water waves. A flaming wheel, a Buddhist symbol, can be seen amongst the waves with other obscured treasures. There are bats throughout the sky, which are a symbol of good luck. Many flowers are embroidered in the background, including peonies. Gold metal-wrapped threads outline auspicious symbols and also make up the geometric border design.",

        "Description": "Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a silver pheasant representing the fifth rank of a civil official. This bird is identified by its white feathers, white crown with a red stripe and long tail.\nThe front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. This rank badge pair was decorated with smooth satin stitches surrounded by couched metal-wrapped threads. Bats (which represent fortune) and auspicious motifs are scattered among coin-shaped clouds. The background is filled with green geometric lines and  wan symbols (similar in form, but not ideology, to a swastika), which symbolize infinity. In the centre of the badge is a silver pheasant standing on rocks above the waves and water, looking toward a red sun in the upper right corner. The position of the sun on the right side of the badge indicates that the badge was used by the spouse of a civil official and decorated with her husband’s rank.",

Narcissus blossoms and birds, a common theme in Zhao’s other works, are both symbols of the start of spring. Zhao also utilizes the ancient Chinese painting colour palette of green and blue to set the atmosphere of this painting. By using incredibly delicate brushstrokes to outline the visual objects, she highlights the landscape’s subtleties, such as the feather of the birds, the moss of the rocks, and the stems, leaves, and petals of narcissus.",

It is a reproduction of a work made by artist Luo Zhijian (b. 1954) of Hu County, Shaanxi, using a painting technique reminiscent of collage. He uses bold and bright colours, with clever use of contrast, to draw the viewer’s attention to the figures at the top of the painting. The women's posture and facial expressions are also expertly captured, conveying a sense of shared purpose and companionship as they work together to complete the task at hand. The details of their clothing, hairstyles, and accessories provide a glimpse into the daily life of rural Chinese women in this time period.",

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. \nThis rank badge features a quail, representing an eighth rank civil official. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges. This bird is perched on a rock and gazing at a sun disc in the top left corner. This badge is woven in tapestry, with gold metal-wrapped thread and details rendered in multi-coloured silk floss. Coloured ink was used for colour gradation.",

Each leaf contains a landscape, which was painted in situ by Wang Gai. Repeating themes throughout the album include figures immersed in the natural environment, which reflects the literati’s yearning and nostalgia.\nIn this scene, a man looks out from his cottage window, which is almost at the centre of the landscape composition. The cottage is surrounded by dense trees, rocks, mountains and a flowing river with a bridge. The distant mountains and sky are painted in a light wash of translucent blue ink.",

        "Description": "This album consists of 12 paintings depicting different scenes of people and animals, accompanied by inscriptions written in regulated verse, featuring four lines of seven characters each (七言绝句). \nThe paintings were done by Ren Yi, also known as Ren Bonian (1840-1895). He was born in Shaoxing, Zhejiang. In 1868, he relocated to Shanghai. This move brought him into a more urban environment that was influenced by Western ideas. In Shanghai, he became part of the Shanghai School, which merged popular and traditional artistic styles. Ren Bonian was recognized alongside Ren Xiong, Ren Xun, and Ren Yu as one of the \"Four Rens.\" \nThe calligraphic poems were crafted by Liu Taixi (1899-1989), a calligrapher commissioned by Zhou Maifu (1929-2011). Based on the inscription on 2004.19.38.20, written by the calligrapher Taixi at the age of 86, the estimated date for the calligraphy is around 1985, nearly 90 years after Ren Yi's death. The time difference indicates that the inscriptions were added to the paintings at a much later date (ca.1985).\nThe golden-yellow cover is made of damask, featuring swirling cloud motifs and circular medallions containing dragons. This album opens vertically. Once flipped open, the top portion features an inscription, while the bottom half displays a painting framed by a damask border with wavy patterns.

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This silk tapestry weave (kesi) rank badge features a leopard, representing a third rank military official. The leopard is perched on a rock and gazing at a sun disk. Surrounding the leopard are ruyi-shaped clouds, the eight Daoist emblems, two bats, and gold scrolls adorned with small flowers. The foreground features a li shui border with standing water waves and ruyi-shaped rolling waves supporting the eight Buddhist treasures.",

        "Description": "Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a tiger embroidered in metal-wrapped threads, which represents a fourth rank military official. The tiger is identified by its black stripes and a wan symbol on its forehead, indicating the tiger is a king. \nThe front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. The embroidery on this badge is rendered entirely in metal-wrapped threads of varying hues, all expertly couched in place with silk floss. The border contains bats and shou characters, which all act as lucky symbols for the wearer. The tiger is positioned in the middle of the badge, above rocks and standing water waves and surrounded by a sky filled with clouds and lotus flowers. The position of the sun on the right side of the badge indicates that the wearer was a woman, likely the spouse of a military official. The tiger is appliquéd onto the badge background so that it may be easily replaced with other beasts as the military official moves up through the ranks.",

        "Description": "Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. \nThis pair of rank badges features a bear, representing a fifth rank military official. The bear insignia is distinguishable from the higher-ranking lion by the absence of a mane along its back, though the two designs share a similarity in overall appearance. This particular badge  is crafted entirely with knot stitches and couched cord. The border is adorned with stylized running dragons, bats, and shou characters (symbolizing longevity)",

        "Description": "A large painting on silk depicting the Nian Rebellion in a landscape with cliffs, mountains, and trees. A strategic perspective, which oversees all of the action from above, allows the viewer to see the swirling government armies in their pursuit of the rebellious Nian. There are small groups of buildings throughout the top third of the painting. Cavalry and infantry are in active combat, with many casualties seen spread around the battlefield. Notable figures have small name plates positioned above their heads to identify them to the viewer.\nThis painting is part of a larger series of approximately 70 paintings commissioned by the Guangxu Emperor in 1885, approved by Empress Dowager Cixi in 1886, and completed in 1890. These paintings - split into four groups - commemorate the Taiping War, the Nian Rebellion, the Muslim Rebellion in Yunnan and Guizhou provinces, and the Muslim Rebellion on the southwest and northwest borders. The military prowess of the Qing government is highlighted and glorified in each of these paintings. Two of these paintings are accessioned in the Mactaggart Art Collection, please see Battle Scene from the Nian Rebellion (2004.19.49).",

        "Description": "Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a leopard rendered in tapestry weave with details painted with ink, representing a third rank military official. The leopard is identified by its spots, which look like geometric marks throughout its body, and green eyebrows, which are typical in the late Qing dynasty. The front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. The leopard is positioned in the center of the badge, surrounded by clouds, small white flowers, bats, and other auspicious symbols. Select details are highlighted with metal-wrapped threads, including the standing water waves below the leopard. The position of the sun on the right side of the badge indicates that the wearer was a woman, likely the spouse of a military official. The border features show characters and bats, which are symbols of luck.",

        "Description": "This is the first leaf from the Figures in River Landscape album by Wang Gai (1677-1705), which is painted with ink and colour on paper. Each leaf contains a landscape, which was painted in situ by Wang Gai. Repeating themes throughout the album include figures immersed in the natural environment, which reflects the literati’s yearning and nostalgia.\nIn this scene a man walks towards a stone bridge which spans a small creek within a larger body of water. He is alone in this painting which evokes a feeling of peaceful solace. The trees, rocks, and other natural elements are sharper and darker in the foreground, fading into a mist in the background. This ink gradient technique, combined with light, translucent colours in the male figure and bridge, create an overall tranquil effect.",

Square badges were worn by courtiers in the Ming (1398-1844) imperial court. The dragon on this badge has been embroidered using gold metal-wrapped silk floss, which has been couched to the backing fabric and add texture to the dragon's scales. This badge was likely worn to celebrate long lives for senior members of the imperial court.",

        "Description": "Lu Shoukun was a renowned Chinese painter and educator who made significant contributions to the New Ink Movement, a contemporary art movement that reinterpreted traditional Chinese ink painting techniques with a modern approach. Having studied painting in the 1930s under the guidance of the distinguished Chinese painter and calligrapher, Zhao Shao'ang, Lui relocated to Hong Kong in 1948. Thereafter, he focused on studying traditional Chinese painting and later integrated the concept of Western modernism with ink painting. Lui commenced writing articles on art and exhibition reviews for local newspapers in 1952.  In 1958, he founded the \"New Art Studio\" to teach painting. Four years later, he was appointed as an honorary advisor to the Hong Kong Museum of Art. In 1968, Lui and his students established the \"In Tao Art Association\" and held their inaugural group exhibition at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. In recognition of his contributions to the arts, Lui was awarded an honorary M.B.E. (Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire) by the British government in Hong Kong in 1971. Lui Shou-Kwan's remarkable achievements continue to inspire many in the realm of contemporary Chinese art.",

This leaf depicts an ink and watercolour drawing of two male figures, possibly “beggars”, as inscribed in pencil at the lower centre section of the leaf. The figure on the left, who appears to be blind, is dressed in a long yellow coat over pants and carries a large bag on his shoulder. The figure on the right is dressed in tattered clothes, carries a small satchel, and is barefoot. Both men have the top and sides of their heads completely shaved with a long braid down the back (a “queue”), which was a regulated Manchu hairstyle during the Qing dynasty.",

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. \nThis rank badge features a panther, symbolizing a sixth rank military official. The panther is crouching on a rock and surrounded by ruyi-shaped clouds and peonies. The pattern on the badge is embroidered using satin and seed stitches.",

This tone-on-tone embroidery style was popular during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) and the delicate satin stitches are meant to recreate the gradient of ink painting. Sleeve bands are the wide decorated cuffs attached to women's robes and jackets.",

The focal point of this poster is a portrait of Lei Feng, surrounded by elementary school children engaged in a variety of activities, including young pioneers being guided by their teacher to take an oath under the red flag, assisting the elderly in crossing the street, learning how to use a computer, and playing soccer and ping pong. Red dominates the image, including the title, which has a powerful visual impact. This poster conveys the spirit of the communist regime in China and has a strong propaganda effect. It seems to raise people’s awareness of following the path of Lei Feng, that is to study hard, live well, and contribute to the modernization of the country.",

The design on this badge, which includes the two phoenixes in an upper and lower position, reflects a typical imperial court style from the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). The phoenix is a mythical creature that is considered to be the highest-ranking bird in Chinese culture. These types of imperial court badges were always worn in pairs, with on badge placed on the front of a robe and an identical badge attached to the back.",

The use of colour in this painting is particularly striking, with the bright blues, light grey, and black of the landscape contrasting with the decorations of white, red, and green. The grey tone looming in the background adds depth to the painting, while also showcasing the rugged beauty of the mountainous terrain.",

        "Description": "This work is one of three impromptu works done at the dinner reception held in the artist’s honour at Alumni House, University of Alberta. Her subject for this work is the famous line by the 9th C. Chinese poet Bai Juyi or Hakurakuten Ch. Bai Luotien, (as he is known best in Japan. ) The line goes: “When there is snow, moon or blossoms, I recall you the most.”  The line itself is revered for its expression of the power the beauty of the four seasons has to move us to appreciate our friends.\n\nThe first three characters of this line, “snow moon blossoms” has become a fixed idiomatic phrase for “the beauty of the four seasons”, so much part of the popular vocabulary that it is even the name of a brand of sake. Kataoka felt that the sentiment of the line suited the occasion, but as she was writing it, on the spur of the moment, she found herself writing “snow, blossoms, moon” instead of “snow moon blossoms”. This might be considered a mistake, but afterwards, Kataoka herself felt that her slip of memory was fortuitous and made the phrase seem fresh rather than hackneyed. In the order that she created, she saw an implied metaphorical relationship between the snow and the blossoms and she liked that. The strong and vibrant line of the calligraphy expresses her joy in the moment.",

Satin weave is paired with one of the fundamental weave structures - plain, satin, or twill weave - to create the motifs. A Jacquard loom is used to create this fabric, which has design motifs woven into the ground.\n\n\nBrocade describes a type of woven fabric that features a multi-coloured pattern created using a discontinuous supplementary weft structure. Brocade is easily identified by the long floats on the backside of the fabric, which occur when the colourful weft yarns are not in use on the surface design. These floats make the fabric slightly thicker than other multi-coloured fabrics, such as tapestry. Brocade fabric can have a variety of ground fabrics, including twill, plain weave, leno, and satin. Brocade is woven on a complex loom (called a “drawloom”)  that is operated by two weavers: one on the top of the loom (“drawboy”) and a second craftsperson operating the lower section. \n\nRelated Definitions:\n\nFiber: Natural (plant or animal) or synthetic material formed into a thread that is longer than it is wide.\n\nWarp: lengthwise yarn that runs from the top to the bottom of the fabric. This yarn is typically held stationary during weaving.\n\nWeft (or Fill or Filling Yarns): crosswise yarn that runs selvedge to selvedge, under and over the warp yarns in varying patterns to create different weave structures.\n\nYarn: A continuous length of interlocked fibers, which may or may not be twisted.\nPlain Weave (or Tabby Weave): the most basic weave structure that consists of one warp and one weft thread intersecting at a right angle. The front and backside of the resulting fabric are the same.\n\nSatin Weave: Four or more weft yarns intersecting with a warp yarn, or vice versa. The resulting floats, which are sections of the yarn that do not intersect, appear on the face of the fabric, producing a very glossy, smooth, and flat appearance.\n\nTwill Weave: one weft thread passing over one or more warp threads and then under two or more warp threads creating diagonal ridges, which are the identifying feature of the resulting fabric. \nRead More +",

The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. \nThese rank badges feature an egret, representing a sixth rank civil official. It is couched in silver thread, with its head highlighted in gold. Perched on one leg atop the stone, it gazes at the sun disc in the top right corner. Surrounding the bird are clouds, Daoist emblems, and gold scrolling vines. Additional auspicious symbols, including Buddhist emblems, are interspersed among ruyi-shaped waves along the li shui border at the bottom. The badge is embroidered using fine counted-stitch embroidery on black silk gauze.",

        "Description": "This hanging scroll by Lu Shoukun (1919-1975) depicts a group of travellers walking on a mountain path. From a bird’s-eye perspective the viewer is given a sense of height and distance in order to reveal the entire scene at once. In the midground of the painting, Lu uses smooth washes of ink to indicate abstract mountainous forms. The varying shades of cyan, gray, and black make the layers of the painting rich and vibrant. The travellers, which are painted using colourful brush strokes outlined in thick black ink, are highly detailed in relation to their environment. The contrast of dark ink washes, detailed figures, and negative space conveys an infinite sense of distance.",

Dressed in a traditional robe with a blue head covering, the figure is shown in a calm, relaxed position, with his arms resting on the rocks. The background is rendered with soft, fluid brushstrokes, evoking the misty atmosphere of the distant hills.\nThe crane, standing on one leg, contrasts with the man’s stillness. In Chinese tradition, the crane, often referred to as the “bird of immortals,” is a symbol of longevity.\nRen Yi (also known as Ren Bonian), the artist, signed his name in black ink in the bottom right corner, accompanied by his red seal.",

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. \nThis rank badge features a peacock, representing a third rank civil official. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges. It is perched on a rock and gazing at a sun disc in the top left corner. The eight Buddhist treasures are scattered throughout the design, including a parasol, endless knot, lotus blossom, victory banner, wheel, vase, carp, and conch shell. This badge is woven in tapestry, with a ground made from gold metal-wrapped thread and details rendered in multi-coloured silk floss. Ink is used for details and outlines.",

The artist's daytime occupation as a civil servant during the Qing Dynasty permitted him free time in which to explore new ways of painting with his whole hand - palm, finger tips, and nails - rather than a traditional paintbrush. With this highly unique technique, Gao produced many similar landscape paintings throughout his life. After the painting is calligraphy by Gao Qipei, dated 1712, that contains sixteen copies of famous calligraphies (zitie) done between the Jin and Song dynasties, followed by an epilogue and a poem.",
        "Inscriptions and Colophons": "The painting is unsigned.  The inscription following the painting is signed by Tieling Gao Qipei and is impressed with 2 artist seals.  The title  and colophon are by Zeng Xi (1861-1930).",

        "Description": "Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. \nThis rank badge features a tiger, symbolizing a fourth rank military official. The tiger is crouching on a rock and surrounded by ruyi-shaped clouds. The pattern on the badge is embroidered with fine seed stitches. The border is adorned with bats and shou characters (symbolizing longevity).",

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. \nThis pair of rank badges features an egret, representing a sixth rank civil official. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird was seen on rank badges. The egret in this badge is surrounded by ruyi-shaped clouds, with its wings outstretched and its gaze fixed on the sun disk in the upper left corner. This badge is woven in tapestry, with a ground made from metallic thread. Coloured ink was used to depict details in the bird’s body.",

These clouds, created with negative space, surround landscape shapes that simultaneously emerge from and disappear into the thick, moist atmosphere.",

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. \nThis pair of rank badges feature a peacock, representing a third rank civil official. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges. It is perched on a rock and gazing at a sun disc in the top left corner. The eight Buddhist treasures are scattered throughout the design, including a parasol, endless knot, lotus blossom, victory banner, wheel, vase, carp, and conch shell. This badge is woven in tapestry, with a ground made from gold metal-wrapped thread and details rendered in multi-coloured silk floss. Ink is used for details and outlines.",

        "Description": "Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. \nThese rank badges feature a flycatcher, representing a ninth rank civil official. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges. The bird perches on rocks, surrounded with bamboo and cherry blossoms. The badge is adorned with counted stitch embroidery on silk gauze.",

The weft threads only pass through specific colourful sections, rather than from selvage to selvage, to create particular patterns in a plain weave. Ke-si fabric has distinctive slits at the edge of each colourful section, which result from the different types of joining techniques used during production. Ke-si fabric is also often completely reversible, depending on the talent of the maker. While the construction is a simple plain weave, the complexity of many differently-coloured yarns means that tapestry fabric can only be woven on a handloom.\n\nThis very time consuming and highly skilled technique often results in fabric that mimics paintings, making it highly valued and appreciated. It was often used in panels that were made in the style of paintings and used as household decorations, but can also be found in garments. \n\nRelated Definitions:\n\nFiber: Natural (plant or animal) or synthetic material formed into a thread that is longer than it is wide.\n\nWarp: lengthwise yarn that runs from the top to the bottom of the fabric. This yarn is typically held stationary during weaving.\n\nWeft (or Fill or Filling Yarns): crosswise yarn that runs selvedge to selvedge, under and over the warp yarns in varying patterns to create different weave structures.\n\nYarn: A continuous length of interlocked fibers, which may or may not be twisted.\nPlain Weave (or Tabby Weave): the most basic weave structure that consists of one warp and one weft thread intersecting at a right angle. The front and backside of the resulting fabric are the same. \nRead More +",

        "Description": "Kataoka modeled this handscroll set on a calligraphic work extant from the year 812  by the master calligrapher Monk Kūkai (774-835).  Designated a National Treasure, this work entitled Kanjō rekimei records the names of monks who took part in a Buddhist initiation ceremony that involves the sprinkling of water over the heads of the participants. Kataoka felt some hesitation in aspiring to follow Kūkai’s example, but for a long time, she had wanted to try to do a work like this that would turn a listing of names into art. \n\nThe occasion was the Provost’s Discussion Evening held in her honour on Oct. 9, 2008. She chose a half-cursive mode of calligraphic style that blends the style of Yan Zhenqing (709-785) with that of Mi Fu (1051-1107). Since most of the participants had western names, it was an additional challenge for Kataoka to quickly come up with suitable phonetic renderings using Chinese characters. For example, the Provost’s name, Carl Amrhein is rendered in full as:\nka-ar-u a-mu-ra-in\n\nSometimes she rendered either just the first or last name, as with Janine Andrews:\nan-do-ryu-su.\n\nThe artistic composition of the piece was achieved by freely positioning the names over the space of the page rather than writing in lines of the same length. This ability to create an impromtu work of art from the simplest materials marks her as a great calligrapher.",

This painting is the second scroll of 12 and it depicts the royal procession traveling along the Grand Canal after leaving Beijing, about to enter the city of Dezhou in Shandong province.\nThe handscroll is quite large, measuring 68.5 x 1686.5 cm, and is viewed from right to left. The painting begins with a poetry inscription by Yu Mingzhong (1714-1779) and has two small seals after his signature. Seven of Emperor Qianlong's seals are impressed on the scroll at the beginning of the painting, including three big square red seals. \nOn the right side of the scroll, the painting features the emperor's escorts and procession. They are crossing the Grand Canal on a floating bridge, surrounded by crowds of local officials and other inhabitants kneeling on either shore, welcoming the Emperor’s procession.\nFurther along in Dezhou, we see officials and other residents anticipating the Emperor’s arrival, as well as architecture and daily life activities in the 18th century. After Dezhou, moving left along the scroll, we see the suburbs outside of the town. Several mounted officers, some of them pulling carts, seem to be part of an advanced imperial entourage going ahead to scout the path for Qianlong Emperor’s smooth journey (Tsang, Ka bo, 2008).\nAt the left end of the picture impressed a small rectangular red seal by the collector Jin Cheng (1879-1926). The seal inscribes six characters as “Jin Gong Bo jing jian yin.” The handscroll has an original carved jade clasp inscribed with the names of Emperor Qianlong, the artist Xu Yang, and the title of the handscroll.",

        "Description": "Emperor Kangxi (r.1661-1722), the third monarch of the Qing Dynasty, made six tours to southern China from 1684 to 1707. He commissioned imperial artist Wang Hui (1632-1717) to document the second tour in 12 handscrolls. This painting is the seventh scroll of the series, which depicts the route from Wuxi to Suzhou during the Emperor’s second tour in 1689.\nThe front fringe of the mounted scroll has one label with three parts: “the picture of the southern inspection tour” (nan-xun-tu), “the seventh scroll “ (di-qi juan), and “the route from Wuxi county to the emperor’s accommodation at Suzhou’s official residence” (zi-wuxi-xian zhubi suzhou-fu). At the beginning of the handscroll, which is viewed from right to left, a poetry inscription, titled “Reverence picture of the seventh scroll”, describes people welcoming the Emperor’s procession along the route. The poetry also honours Emperor Kangxi for his mercy and granting tax waivers to the Suzhou people. The scroll bears no red seals.\nFollowing the inscription, the painting begins with the countryside scenery of Qingyuan, Huishan temple, and Xishan. Further along, we see Wuxi county with boats on the river and busy streets along the canal. Afterwards, the scenery shows Xin-an, Hu-shu-guan (a bustling city with cargo ships and tax collecting near the Grand Canal), Shan-tang, and Hu-Qiu. In all of these places there is flourishing urban life, both on the streets and the river. Following these cities, we see Chanmen (the Chan gate) of Suzhou and the Emperor’s procession in ships surrounded by a welcoming parade on the dock. The scene moves into the city of Suzhou, showing the busy streets with decorations and the gathering crowds anticipating the Emperor’s arrival. Further to the left, near the end of the painting, we see the Suzhou Weaving Office, which is preparing for the Emperor’s arrival.",

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a goose, which represents the fourth rank of a civil official.\nThe front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. This rank badge pair was decorated with counted stitch embroidery made from polychrome silk floss and metal-wrapped threads. In the center of the badge is a goose standing on rocks and surrounded by waves. The bird is looking toward a red sun at the upper left corner. Blue curvilinear clouds fill the background of the top of the badge, while interlinked ruyi clouds form a line underneath the waves. The bottom shows diagonal stripes, representing standing water, woven in two-toned metal-wrapped threads. The Eight Buddhist Treasures are scattered throughout, including the parasol, canopy, endless knot and lotus in the sky, and the vase, fish, conch, and wheel in the waves. The border of the badge features black embroidery with bats (which represent fortune) and longevity characters.",

Mythical phoenixes or fenghuang, which are feminine in contrast to the masculine dragon, were reserved for women of the highest rank and they represent their power. Another symbol on the robe appears as two versions of the shou character, which symbolizes longevity. \nBoldly coloured peonies - in pink, mauve, blue, and white - fill the background of the main fabric. These flowers have been expertly rendered in a flat, even satin stitch with an ombre effect, providing dimension to every blossom. Peonies are the flower related to springtime and their inclusion on this robe may represent the feminine beauty of the wearer. The blue background with a mauve border, made from aniline dyes introduced from Europe at the end of the nineteenth century. Although we cannot officially confirm this robe was owned by Empress Dowager Cixi, she was known to have a fondness for peonies, and this style of robe certainly influenced the style of multiple other extant robes.\nIn the late Qing dynasty, chenyi, or informal court robes, became popular among the imperial elite women as this garment was not regulated by official codes and could be styled in multiple colours, motifs, and shapes, as opposed to more formal robes. In comparison to another informal robe style, the changyi, this robe has narrower sleeves and no side slits. The sleeves follow the general shape of more formal Manchu style robes, which would typically extend longer and end in a horse hoof-shaped cuff, and the inclusion of phoenixes still follows the conventions of formal court attire.",

        "Description": "The mounting style of the scroll is called Yamato jitate. Yamato stands for Japan and this is a unique Japanese style of scroll mounting. It is comprised of three components: the thick upper and thin lower horizontal border of kinran gold brocade immediately adjacent to the work, called ichi monji “letter one” because individually they look like the Chinese character for 1. The middle surround, or nakamawashi,  in this case of checkered damask, and the extension of the scroll length with an upper and a lower piece of silk, which are together called tenchi or heaven and earth. Finally, there are two strips of the same gold brocade as the ichi monji that are suspended from the top roller. These are called fūtai “wind ties” and are meant to move in the slightest bit of breeze.\n\nThe content of this work comes from the 11th C. Wakan rōei shū (Japanese and Chinese Poems to Sing), an anthology arranged in an encyclopaedic fashion under general topics. This scroll displays three entries from the Felicitations and Congratulations section.  Kataoka chose verses from this section to express her warm congratulations for the new quarters of the Prince Takamado Japan Centre in Pembina Hall at the University of Alberta. The Wakan rōei shū is comprised of Japanese poems in the traditional waka form (31 syllables) and couplets taken from poems in classical Chinese composed by both Chinese and Japanese poets. In this scroll, reading from the right to the left, there is a couplet from a poem done by a 7th C. Chinese poet, an anonymous Japanese waka in the middle and a couplet from a Chinese poem composed by a Japanese poet of the 10th C. \n\nKataoka has given three different calligraphic treatments to the three entries. The first couplet by the Chinese poet is written with thick strokes in a calligraphic style, that is, however, known as wayō tai (Japanese style). It is a formal way of writing Chinese that has been softened with a cursive touch. The middle waka shows the distinctive style of writing that was developed for the Japanese kana phonetic script. Kana evolved from writing Chinese characters with radical abbreviation and a high degree of cursiveness. In addition, the composition of the lines on the page is very free, in a style known as chirashigaki “scattered writing”. The Chinese couplet by the Japanese poet is written in a moderately cursive style, which is, however, to a calligraphy expert’s eye recognizable as a traditional Chinese style. The Wakan rōei shū anthology itself brings together Chinese and Japanese verse in a spirit of cheerful syncretism and Kataoka has complemented this with her calligraphic treatment , which gives a Japanese style to the Chinese poet’s couplet and a Chinese style to the Japanese poet’s couplet, joining the two together with  the light and tensile Japanese script in the middle.",

The ink and watercolour scene on this leaf shows a man (the “thief”) being punished with a large stick, possibly made of bamboo, by three officials. Two of the officials hold the man on the ground, where he is being struck on his buttocks by a third official. The officials wear hats with red tassels and small finials, which are a typical part of officials’ costumes in the Qing dynasty. The man being punished has the top and sides of his head completely shaved with a long braid down the back (a “queue”), which was a regulated Manchu hairstyle during the Qing dynasty.",

        "Description": "Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a leopard rendered in tapestry weave with details painted with ink, representing a third rank military official. The leopard is identified by its spots, which look like geometric marks throughout its body, and green eyebrows, which are typical in the late Qing dynasty. The front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. The leopard is positioned in the center of the badge, surrounded by clouds, small white flowers, bats, and other auspicious symbols. Select details are highlighted with metal-wrapped threads, including the standing water waves below the leopard. The position of the sun on the right side of the badge indicates that the wearer was a woman, likely the spouse of a military official. The border features show characters and bats, which are symbols of luck.",

Each leaf contains a landscape, which was painted in situ by Wang Gai. Repeating themes throughout the album include figures immersed in the natural environment, which reflects the literati’s yearning and nostalgia.\nIn this scene there are several mountain peaks around a body of water, which is painted with a dark ink wash rather than negative space, as done in other leaves in this album. There are two faintly-painted figures hiking on the mountain trail in the bottom left corner. Partially-hidden cottages are included along the shoreline and there is dense foliage dotted amongst the rocks and landscape.",

The box consists of a lower container, decorated with gold linework along the bottom edges, and a decorated lid that covers the bottom container. The lid has an inscription label on top, which reads “the picture of the Southern Inspection tour, the seventh scroll” (nan-xun-tu di-qi-juan) and “the second month of the 28th year of the Kangxi period in zi-si cyclical year” (kangxi erh-shi-ba nien zi-si-erh yue), which corresponds to 1698. Under the written inscription is a square seal that states “precious collection of the Celestial Palace” (tien-fu-Jen-cang). \nThe lid is decorated with gilt dragons and clouds against the black lacquer background. There are nine dragons on the lid: three vertical dragons moving among clouds on the top, two horizontal dragons on each long side and one front-facing coiled dragon on each short side. A label with “Emperor Kangxi” (Kangxi-yeh) in calligraphy is pasted on one of the short sides.",

A brilliant four petal-shaped brocade decorates the centre of the canopy, containing two active dragons. These dragons, woven in gold-wrapped threads and polychrome silk floss, have four claws (mang) and are surrounded by vivid red flames. There are colourful clouds scattered around the dragons, with four sets of clouds forming a ring in the centre, where they would have initially surrounded the neckline of a robe. Woven waves and rocks provide a border around the petal shape. \nAt close inspection, the dark brown background is a satin damask with a continuous cloud pattern. Both the background damask and dragon brocade were woven in one piece. This canopy, although following a typical Ming era court robe style, would have been used to decorate the top of a temple.",

This leaf contains an ink and watercolour painting that is slightly different, stylistically, from other paintings in the album. It depicts a man in military dress mounted on a horse, which is also protected by armour. The man holds a musket and has multiple swords attached to his uniform. The horse's legs are red at the lower ends. Above the figure are enlarged examples of material culture carried by the man, including two sheathed blades, shields, a musket, and a helmet.",

The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. \nThese rank badges feature a quail, representing an eighth rank civil official. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges. This bird is perched on a rock and gazing at a sun disc in the top left corner. This badge is woven in tapestry, with gold metal-wrapped thread and details rendered in multi-coloured silk floss.

In the background, the heads of the tree exceed the parapet wall, which has a motif of jumbled semicircles framed by rectangles. Atop a standing shelf sits an incense burner, with smoke rising into the air. The foliage behind the structure shows the season, possibly late autumn, due to the brownish hues.\nThe inscription on the right writes “Ren Yi, also known as Ren Bonian from Shanyin [山陰仁颐伯年[???],” and the red seal belongs to him.",

        "Description": "The painting depicts a crowded plaza scene with people performing the traditional Dragon Dance in celebration of a festival. The composition of the painting is dynamic, with the long dragon snaking through the plaza and a multitude of people watching and participating in the festivities. The atmosphere is lively and joyful. The use of colour in the painting is particularly striking, with the bright colours of the dragon and the people's clothing contrasting with the neutral tones of the brown in the background. The intricate details of the dragon's scales, the people's clothing give the painting a sense of liveness, while the stylized forms of the people and the dragon add a touch of naivety to the overall composition.",

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. \nThis rank badge features an egret, representing a sixth rank civil official. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird was seen on rank badges. The egret in this badge is surrounded by ruyi-shaped clouds, with its wings outstretched and its gaze fixed on the sun disk in the upper left corner. This badge is woven in tapestry, with a ground made from metallic thread. Coloured ink was used to depict details in the bird’s body.",

        "Description": "Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a tiger embroidered in metal-wrapped threads, which represents a fourth rank military official. The tiger is identified by its black stripes and a wan symbol on its forehead, indicating the tiger is a king. \nThe front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. The embroidery on this badge is rendered entirely in metal-wrapped threads of varying hues, all expertly couched in place with silk floss. The border contains bats and shou characters, which all act as lucky symbols for the wearer. The tiger is positioned in the middle of the badge, above rocks and standing water waves and surrounded by a sky filled with clouds and lotus flowers. The position of the sun on the right side of the badge indicates that the wearer was a woman, likely the spouse of a military official. The tiger is appliquéd onto the badge background so that it may be easily replaced with other beasts as the military official moves up through the ranks.",

        "Description": "This hanging scroll by Zhang Hong (b. 1954) depicts a pink mountain range with waterfalls emerging above the clouds, which have been created using negative space. The overall composition reveals artist Zhang Hong’s diligent study of Chinese “orthodox” landscape painting skills. Orthodox painting focuses on the natural world and the depiction of landscapes as idealized and harmonious spaces, with an emphasis on brushwork, composition and the use of ink wash. Zhang incorporates orthodox school techniques in his painting through the use of brushstrokes to create a sense of movement and dynamism, as well as the delicate balance of gradient tones to depict natural elements. His emphasis on negative space in the depiction of clouds and waterfalls is a technique often used in the orthodox school, and helps to create a sense of depth and space within the painting.",

Nine dragons appear in typical fashion - three on the front, three on the back, two on either shoulder, and one hidden under the outer flap. The narrow sleeve shape follows a typical Manchu imperial court robe with dark blue sleeve inserts and a horse hoof-shaped cuff. Embroidered collar facings and sleeve cuffs feature five-clawed dragons couched in gold metal-wrapped thread, clouds, bats, and auspicious wan symbols. Narrow, gold metal-wrapped thread brocade trim in a geometric pattern edges these borders.\nAuspicious symbols can be seen throughout the robe, including the Buddhist eight treasures of lotus, parasol, wheel of the law, victory banner, conch, fish, endless knot, and vase. The hem of this robe has a typical rocks, waves, and standing water pattern. The wan symbol can be found throughout the robe background, which represents \"eternity\" or \"infinity\".",

Each leaf contains a landscape, which was painted in situ by Wang Gai. Repeating themes throughout the album include figures immersed in the natural environment, which reflects the literati’s yearning and nostalgia.\nIn this scene, a man stands on a shore at the bottom of a tall cliff, with his hands folded behind his back, observing the surrounding trees and distant blue mountains. The mountains, the trees shedding leaves and the colours in the painting reveal that the fall season is approaching.",

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a tiger embroidered in metal-wrapped threads, which represents a fourth rank military official. The tiger is identified by its black stripes and a wan symbol on its forehead, indicating the tiger is a king. \nThe front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. The embroidery on this badge is rendered entirely in metal-wrapped threads of varying hues, all expertly couched in place with silk floss. The border contains bats and shou characters, which all act as lucky symbols for the wearer. The tiger is positioned in the middle of the badge, above rocks and standing water waves and surrounded by a sky filled with clouds and lotus flowers. The position of the sun on the right side of the badge indicates that the wearer was a woman, likely the spouse of a military official. The tiger is appliquéd onto the badge background so that it may be easily replaced with other beasts as the military official moves up through the ranks.",

It presents a serene scene featuring two figures—a man and a young attendant —sitting on a rock beside a bamboo grove. The man is reading a book held in his hands. His hair is styled in a topknot, giving him a scholarly appearance. The attendant, positioned behind him and slightly to the side, rests his head on his folded arms.\nThe bamboo grove occupies the left side of the composition, with tall and straight stalks. The background remains minimal, with subtle ink washes creating the impression of a misty, tranquil atmosphere.\nThe inscription on the left reads, “Ren Yi, also known as Ren Bonian from Shanyin [山陰仁頤伯年],” and the red seal belongs to Ren Yi.",

Each leaf contains a landscape, which was painted in situ by Wang Gai. Repeating themes throughout the album include figures immersed in the natural environment, which reflects the literati’s yearning and nostalgia.\nThis scene contains a scene of solitude within an all-encompassing landscape, in which a scholar and his attendant can be seen conversing in a cottage on the bank of a river. The two cottages, which are on stilts, are surrounded by the river, the mountains and a few pine trees. The foliage in the foreground is much darker and sharper than the landscape in the distance, which creates distance and also a misty dream-like atmosphere. The mountains in the far distance are painted with a wash of light blue paint, which adds to the peaceful scene.",

Each leaf contains a landscape, which was painted in situ by Wang Gai. Repeating themes throughout the album include figures immersed in the natural environment, which reflects the literati’s yearning and nostalgia.\nIn this scene, a solitary man sits under a thatched hut along the bank of the river. The landscape appears quite barren, aside from a large tree shading the hut.",

The qilin have been rendered in gold metal-wrapped threads, which have been couched into place to add texture to their bodies. They are surrounded by peonies, other flowers, and auspicious symbols. Even though use of the dragon motif was restricted through the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties, civilians and lower-ranking courtiers still coveted dragon designs. In order to avoid violating regulations set out by the imperial courts, variations of the dragon motif were applied to textiles, garments, and other material culture.",

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a goose, which represents the fourth rank of a civil official.\nThe front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. This rank badge pair was decorated with counted stitch embroidery made from polychrome silk floss and metal-wrapped threads. In the center of the badge is a goose standing on rocks and surrounded by waves. The bird is looking toward a red sun at the upper left corner. Blue curvilinear clouds fill the background of the top of the badge, while interlinked ruyi clouds form a line underneath the waves. The bottom shows diagonal stripes, representing standing water, woven in two-toned metal-wrapped threads. The Eight Buddhist Treasures are scattered throughout, including the parasol, canopy, endless knot and lotus in the sky, and the vase, fish, conch, and wheel in the waves. The border of the badge features black embroidery with bats (which represent fortune) and longevity characters.",

This sleeve band mirrors the scene of its partner, which depicts five children - all boys - playing in a garden amongst peonies, peaches, trees, and rocks. The children are dressed in garments that were popular for youth in the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). A boy near the top of the band holds a conch shell, which is an auspicious Buddhist symbol. Although this band is woven in kesi, details have been added with painted ink, including colour gradients in the flowers and children's clothing. Sleeve bands are the wide decorated cuffs attached to women's robes and jackets, often made and sold separately from the rest of the garment. They became important commercial objects in the Qing Dynasty as they are modular accessories that could be purchased in a market and attached to the garment at home.",

A strategic perspective from atop a mountain oversees all of the action, including various army camps and infantry. Some mounted soldiers appear in active pursuit of their enemy, while other regiments march in formation. Notable figures have small name plates positioned above their heads to identify them to the viewer.\nThis painting is part of a larger series of approximately 70 paintings commissioned by the Guangxu Emperor in 1885, approved by Empress Dowager Cixi in 1886, and completed in 1890. These paintings - split into four groups - commemorate the Taiping War, the Nian Rebellion, the Muslim Rebellion in Yunnan and Guizhou provinces, and the Muslim Rebellion on the southwest and northwest borders. The military prowess of the Qing government is highlighted and glorified in each of these paintings. Two of these paintings are accessioned in the Mactaggart Art Collection, please see Battle Scene from the Muslim Rebellions in Shaanxi, Gansu and Xinjiang Provinces (2004.19.92)",

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This rank badge features a crane, representing a first rank civil official. It is centrally-positioned, perched on a rock with its wings outstretched, gazing toward the sun in the upper left corner. Surrounding the birds are peonies, clouds, and auspicious ornaments.",

        "Description": "Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a silver pheasant representing the fifth rank of a civil official. This bird is identified by its white feathers, white crown with a red stripe and long tail.\nThe front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. This rank badge pair was decorated with delicate seed stitches, also referred to as “Peking knots” or ta tzu. Gold metal-wrapped thread is couched around some of the colourful motifs as a border. In the centre of the badge, a silver pheasant, standing on rocks above waves, looks toward a red sun in the upper left corner. An embellished canopy floats above the bird, while the Eight Buddhist treasures surround it, including lotuses, the wheel, the parasol, the vase, the conch, the fish and the endless knot. The border of the badge is decorated with blue and white floral motifs and gold geometric patterns.",

        "Description": "Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a silver pheasant representing the fifth rank of a civil official. This bird is identified by its white feathers, white crown with a red stripe and long tail.\nThe front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. This rank badge pair was decorated with smooth satin stitches surrounded by couched metal-wrapped threads. Bats (which represent fortune) and auspicious motifs are scattered among coin-shaped clouds. The background is filled with green geometric lines and  wan symbols (similar in form, but not ideology, to a swastika), which symbolize infinity. In the centre of the badge is a silver pheasant standing on rocks above the waves and water, looking toward a red sun in the upper right corner. The position of the sun on the right side of the badge indicates that the badge was used by the spouse of a civil official and decorated with her husband’s rank.",

        "Description": "This robe is a traditional style of Tibetan robe, or a chuba, made from yellowish-orange damask with vivid brocade, on the top and the bands on cuffs and skirt, woven together into one fabric, which was imported from China. In Tibet  it was constructed in the local style: right side opening with overlapping front, long narrow sleeves, and a full length hem.\nThe pattern design was influenced by a Ming-era court robe cloth from the 17th century, or possibly even earlier. Two large dragons wind across the shoulders in a petal shape and a band along the hem and cuffs features more dragons. The yellowish-orange ground fabric is satin damask with cloud motifs.\nUnderneath the overlap there are patches cut from different fabrics and pieced together. The lining is a green cotton cloth printed with dragon and auspicious motifs. This printed cotton can be traced to the early 20th century. The robe demonstrates how Tibetans used vintage Chinese silk and new cotton fabric to create their unique style of garment.",

The upper part of the scroll is mainly composed of rocky mountain cliffs, with the Qin bridge and a house below. Lai Shaoqi (1915 -2000) employs different-sized colour blocks to represent the unusual rocks and utilizes comparatively fine brush strokes to sketch the house under the mountain. He uses diluted ink, ochre, and stone blue (shi qing, 石青) in layers to create a heavy, yet tranquil painting. Contrast between the white of the modest house at the bottom of the hill and the slightly muted hues of the rocks on the cliff adds interest to the composition.",

        "Description": "This robe is a traditional style of Tibetan robe, or a chuba, made from embroidered yellow silk satin fabric, which was initially made for a dragon robe and imported to Tibet from the Qing imperial court. In Tibet, tailors modified the collar and sleeves to  suit the local style better. Thus the robe has yellow satin parts, without embroidery patterns, around the neckline and sleeve ends. The robe features motifs of dragons with flaming pearls, long thin clouds, rocks, waves and colourful striped water at the hem. There are eight dragons on the exterior of the robe: one on the chest, one on the back, one on each shoulder, and two on the front and back of the lower robe. As is typically seen in Chinese dragon robes, there is a hidden ninth dragon underneath the right overlap.\nThere are the Twelve Symbols embroidered on the robe: the sun with a three-legged bird and the moon with a rabbit are placed on shoulders, stars and mountains are above the dragon’s head on the front and back, dragons, a pheasant, an axe, the fu symbol, cups, seaweed, flames, and grain. The placement of these symbols align with the Qing imperial costume regulations for the emperor’s dragon robe.",

        "Description": "A dark blue silk satin surcoat (or bufu) with metal-wrapped thread embroidered rank badges on the front and back. There is a crane depicted on the square rank badges, identifying the wearer as a first-rank civil official. Cranes are illustrated with red caps and this crane has a vibrant one against the gold metal-wrapped thread couched into the rest of the badge. The position of the sun, the only other red spot in the badge, on the left side of the badge (the wearer's right side) indicates that the wearer is a man. The Buddhist eight auspicious signs surround the crane - from the top, clockwise: lotus, parasol, wheel of the law, victory banner, conch, fish, endless knot, and vase. Below the crane are waves and rocks with standing water underneath. This surcoat has a typical front opening with five brass buttons, and three vents - two at the sides and one in the back. Garments like this were used to represent the wearer's identity to the broader society and, as such, it would have been worn as an outer garment over robes, as seen in the Family Portrait painting (2007.23.1). Consorts and children often wore badges that declared the patriarch's rank as well.",

The perspective is voyeuristic, revealing only the back of the boy and the side profile of the man. The man holds a white drinking vessel in his left hand, while the boy blows on a reed.\nIn the bottom left corner, Ren Yi wrote “the Seal of Bonian [伯年 印]” along with his red personal seal.",

There is an official’s hat on the lower left of the scene, likely belonging to the man wielding the club. The kneeling figure is wearing pants with a mid-length top, while the two standing figures are wearing official’s robes. The two figures without hats have the top and sides of their heads completely shaved with a long braid down the back (a “queue”), which was a regulated Manchu hairstyle during the Qing dynasty.",

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. \nThis pair of rank badges features a qilin, representing a first rank military official. The qilin is surrounded by ruyi-shaped clouds, with its head turned toward the sun disk in the upper left corner. This badge is made of silk floss and metal-wrapped thread embroidery on silk satin.",

        "Description": "Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges. \nThis pair of rank badges features a golden pheasant, representing a second-rank civil official. It is perched on a rock and gazing at a sun disc in the top left corner. Surrounding the birds in this badge are clouds and waves. These badges are made with gold and silver metal-wrapped thread and details rendered in multi-coloured silk floss.",

This leaf depicts an ink and watercolour drawing of a husband and wife in mourning dress “after the loss of [a] father”. During the Qing dynasty, mourning costume, or sangfu, was white or light coloured and was meant to be worn for a specified period of time, depending on the relationship of the mourner to the decedent and the decedent’s social status. The female figure, on the left, wears a white cloth covering her head, as well as a long white jacket over a light brown pleated skirt (likely made from hemp). She also appears to have bound feet, and may be of Han descent. The male figure, on the right, wears a light brown hat and robe (also likely made from hemp) over white leggings. They both are holding staffs, which signify the physical weakness that one feels during the emotional pain of grieving.",

Repeating themes throughout the album include figures immersed in the natural environment, which reflects the literati’s yearning and nostalgia.\nThis scene depicts a man sitting against the trunk of a leafless pine tree in contemplation of nature. All the elements in the painting are concentrated centrally and surrounded by a mountain valley, which is suggested with unpainted negative space.",

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts.\nThis rank badge features a silver pheasant, representing a fifth rank civil official. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges. It is perched on a rock and gazing at a sun disc in the top right corner. The pattern on the badge is embroidered with fine seed stitches of multicoloured silk floss. The metallic  background is made from couched gold metal-wrapped thread.",

This leaf depicts and ink and watercolour drawing of two female figures, possibly of Han ancestry and of a lower social standing. The woman on the left is slightly better dressed in a decorated pleated skirt, mid-length robe with cuffed wide sleeves, and short vest. Her higher standing may be indicated by her bound feet, bangles on each arm, and hair pin. She also carries a handkerchief and a small fan. The woman on the right is wearing a mid-length jacket over a pleated skirt and pants – an outfit that is not decorated and better suited for working. Her feet have not been bound, and she carries a basket and large fan.",

The silk multicoloured tapestry has motifs of dragons, clouds, waves and rocks. The green silk brocade with metal-wrapped threads is patterned with floral and xi characters, which mean happiness.\nThe inner section is pieced together from fragments of Chinese tapestry. That shows two dragons face to face, yet one of the dragons has been cut off on the right side. The dragons, which have four claws on each foot,  are both standing on one leg. Their  heads face upward with open mouths that show off their pointy white teeth. The ends of their tails resemble fishtails sweeping the tops of the waves and mountains below. The images of the dragons’ postures, sharp teeth, fierce claws, and muscular tails reveal a design style of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644).",

There are nine dragons on the robe, including four on the top (the chest, back, and shoulders), four on the lower areas and a hidden dragon under the front overflap. Blue clouds and red bats are scattered throughout the background, with rocks, waves, and colourful diagonal stripes along the hem. Significantly, this dragon robe has the Twelve Symbols of Imperial Authority, which include the sun, moon, stars, mountains, dragons, an axe, the fu symbol, a pheasant, the grains, cups, flames and seaweed. The symbols are placed specifically on the robe according to court regulations.",

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. \nThis rank badge features a flycatcher, representing a ninth rank civil official. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges. The bird perches on rocks, surrounded with bamboo and cherry blossoms. The badge is adorned with counted stitch embroidery on silk gauze.",
