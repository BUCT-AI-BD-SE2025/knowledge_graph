The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a leopard rendered in tapestry weave with details painted with ink, representing a third rank military official. The leopard is identified by its spots, which look like geometric marks throughout its body, and green eyebrows, which are typical in the late Qing dynasty.
The front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. The leopard is positioned in the center of the badge, surrounded by clouds, small white flowers, bats, and other auspicious symbols. Select details are highlighted with metal-wrapped threads, including the standing water waves below the leopard. The position of the sun on the right side of the badge indicates that the wearer was a woman, likely the spouse of a military official.

2005.5.547,,,,unknown,,textiles,,,,,,,,,Gift of Sandy and Cécile Mactaggart,,Chinese,,,1875-1908,,,"Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a goose, which represents the fourth rank of a civil official.
The front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. This rank badge pair was decorated with counted stitch embroidery made from polychrome silk floss and metal-wrapped threads. In the center of the badge is a goose standing on rocks and surrounded by waves. The bird is looking toward a red sun at the upper left corner. Blue curvilinear clouds fill the background of the top of the badge, while interlinked ruyi clouds form a line underneath the waves. The bottom shows diagonal stripes, representing standing water, woven in two-toned metal-wrapped threads. The Eight Buddhist Treasures are scattered throughout, including the parasol, canopy, endless knot and lotus in the sky, and the vase, fish, conch, and wheel in the waves. The border of the badge features black embroidery with bats (which represent fortune) and longevity characters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,gold wrapped silk thread; linen; silk; silk floss; silver wrapped silk thread; embroidery,"Embroidery

,,,,Shi Lu,"Chinese, 1919-1982",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,date unknown,,,"Shi Lu was a prominent Chinese painter and wood engraving artist. Shi was known for his highly textured, dynamic paintings that employed strong colors and bold, expressive brushwork. Shi was originally named Feng Yaheng but later changed his name to Shi Lu in honour of two artists who influenced his work: the 17th-century painter Shitao and the 19th-century writer Lu Xun. He received training in guohua painting (a traditional Chinese style of ink-and-wash painting) at Dongfang Art College in Chengdu in 1934 before enrolling at West China Union University in Chengdu in 1938. After joining the Communist Party in 1946, Shi incorporated elements of social realism into his style. He travelled to India and Egypt as a representative of the People's Republic of China in 1955-56. During the Cultural Revolution, he was publicly denounced and imprisoned for three years due to the “Hei Hua shijian” (The Black Painting exhibition), which criticized his bourgeois ideas and ""counter-revolutionary"" styles. The experience led to severe persecution and humiliation on him. Although he was released in 1970, his imprisonment caused his health to deteriorate until his death in 1982.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Shi Lu,Chinese,hanging scroll,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://search.museums.ualberta.ca/g/14-9033

The standing collar is not a typical design feature on surcoats, which can be seen when compared to other examples in the collection, such as Blue Silk Gauze Surcoat for a Man (2005.5.93).

2005.5.232,,,,unknown,,textiles,,,,,,,,,Gift of Sandy and Cécile Mactaggart,,Chinese,,,1368-1644,,,"Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges. 
This Ming-era rank badge features a pair of golden pheasants, representing a second-rank civil official. Surrounding the birds in this badge are peonies and clouds. The lower bird is perched on a scholar's rock, which are particularly-shaped rocks appreciated by the literati and found in Chinese gardens.

2005.27,,,,"Kataoka, Shikō",,,,,,,,,,,Gift of the artist,,,Japanese,,ca. 2000,,,"The subject for this work comes from the Noh play, Hagoromo “Feathered Robe”, which is based on a legend about a heavenly maiden. 

The maiden descends from heaven to bathe in the beautiful waters of Mio Inlet. While she is bathing, she hangs her feathered robe on the branches of a pine tree where it is found by a fisherman. At first, the fisherman refuses to return her robe, but he is finally moved by her tearful entreaties. Without her robe, she will be unable to return to heaven and will wither away.  He asks her to dance for him if he returns her robe, to which request she happily agrees. She dons the robe, dances for him and then flies away to heaven at the end of the piece.  
Kataoka has taken two excerpts from the play for this work. The text in large Chinese characters on the blue paper on the right panel is an invocation of the Bodhisattva Daiseishi who is associated with the moon. The artist has done this section with a large brush emulating the calligraphic style of the Tang Dynasty master, Yan Zenqing (709 - 784.)

The two sheets on the left panel are excerpts from the last section of the play. Together, they comprise the climax of the play.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ink on paper,,,overall: 152.3 cm x 137.5 cm x 1.8 cm; image: 148.5 cm x 135.7 cm,,,,painting,,,,,,,,"Japan: Hyōgo, Takarazuka",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Feathered Robe,,,,,https://media.museums.ualberta.ca/UAAC/ppt/2005/05_027s01v01d04.jpg,https://search.museums.ualberta.ca/11-21097
2008.14.6.1,,,,"Kataoka, Shikō",,,,,,,,,,,Gift of the artist,,,Japanese,,2008,,,"A technique known as kurinuki shitate has been used to insert the papers into the framing fabric. If the papers were merely glued onto the backing fabric, it would be impossible to roll the scroll without creating wrinkles in the paper. The framing fabric for this work is the rarest material used in the Kataoka Calligraphy collection. It is donsu, damask silk, on which mother-of-pearl powder from blue seashells has been applied to the woven floral pattern to provide a subtle iridescence. The donsu silk already shifts in hue in accordance with the viewer’s point of view and source of light, but the addition of the mother-of-pearl makes this shifting in hue more dramatic. The cutting of such precious cloth to insert the paper takes a sure, practiced hand. A further subtle accent to this work is a thin border of red silk around each of the papers.

Kataoka has a deep affection for the earliest anthology of Japanese poetry, the Manyōshū (compiled c. 750). When she was searching its pages for a subject for this scroll, she was pleased to come upon a poem that mentions the Takamado district in Nara from which Prince Takamado’s name is derived. Since she was creating the work for an exhibition at the Prince Takamado Japan Center for Teaching and Research, an underlying theme for which was the remembrance of Prince Takamado, she felt this poem was especially appropriate. The poems of the Manyōshū were recorded before an efficient script for transcribing the Japanese language had been developed. The script used in the 8th C. is known as manyōgana, so named for its use in the transcription of the Manyōshū. It employs Chinese characters sometimes for meaning and sometimes for sound. Thus, it looks entirely like Chinese but is unreadable as Chinese. Kataoka rendered the manyōgana here in a lightly cursive, “running” style.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ink on coloured paper mounted on silk,,,overall: 160.3 cm x 59.5 cm x 2.5 cm; image: 83.3 cm x 45.2 cm,,,,hanging scroll,,,,,,,,"Japan: Hyōgo, Takarazuka",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Autumn Fields at Takamado,,,,,https://media.museums.ualberta.ca/UAAC/ppt/2008/08_014_006_001s01v01.jpg,https://search.museums.ualberta.ca/11-22732

2008.14.9,,,,"Kataoka, Shikō",,,,,,,,,,,Gift of the artist,,,Japanese,,2008,,,"Pine charcoal ink was used for this work, in contrast to the oil soot based ink that was used in all the other works. Pine charcoal based ink gives a broader range of “colour” than the soot based ink including a bluish hue when it is used in a pale concentrations, as in this work. The work has been framed with a wide border that slopes in, creating a deep recess over which the work is raised to give a “floating” effect. The frame is of dark brown stained horse chestnut wood.

This work demonstrates a modern expressive treatment of a single Chinese character. The use of pale ink for the rendering of Chinese characters is a special feature of modern calligraphy. The silk creates a “bleeding out” effect on the lines and the pine charcoal ink yields different colours in pale concentrations, all of which assist the desired effect for this piece by the artist.

He extensively studied and replicated ancient masterpieces in the Palace Museum, with a particular emphasis on the works from the Song emperor Huizong's collection, which helped shape his unique style in drawing refined and sophisticated bird-and-flower paintings. Yu utilized fine, pointed brushes to create highly detailed depictions of petals, leaves, feathers, and other natural elements, often creating vivid and vibrant images of flowers and birds.

This robe has a nine-dragon pattern, with three five-clawed dragons on the front and back, one on either shoulder, and one hidden dragon under the front flap. The gauze on the robe is embroidered with metal-wrapped threads and multicoloured silk floss using a counted stitch technique, which continues on the trim around the collar and horse-hoof cuffs. There are open slits on the front, back, and two sides of the robe. The Twelve Symbols of Imperial Authority, which demonstrate the emperor's divine right to rule, can be found interspersed throughout the front, back, and shoulders of the robe. The sun, moon, and stars reflect the emperor’s constant shining over his territory and people. The mountains reflect the emperor's stable nature, the dragons illustrate his marvelous character, the pheasant represents literary ability, the cups, which are decorated with monkeys, symbolize faithfulness and respect, the seaweed represents a clean mind, the flames symbolize brightness, the axe reveals strong resolve, the fu character symbolizes a discerning mind, and the grain represents his ability to feed his people. The placement of these Twelve Symbols on a garment varied according to the costume regulations implemented by authorities. In the Qing dynasty (1644–1911), only the emperor and his heir could wear the complete set of twelve symbols. The sun, moon, stars, mountains, dragons, pheasant, axe, and fu symbols were placed at the top of the robe; the cups, flames, seaweed, and grain decorate the lower area of the robe. This robe also has a typical standing wave pattern at the hem, with crashing waves and mountains above.

Two strands of glass beads hang off the right side of the necklace, while the single strand hangs off the left. Each of these strands contains two groups of five beads on a silk cord and end in a blue-purple glass pendant with a small white bead and gold connector. A flat blue silk cord with wan symbols and blue glass pendants hangs down the back of the wearer's neck as a counterweight. This counterweight strand is connected to the rest of the necklace by a jade-coloured glass bead. Near this bead, the necklace cord is wrapped with white, purple and blue silk thread and has two white circular connectors with four holes. Court necklaces have 108 beads divided into four sets of 27 beads, which are separated by large Buddha beads (futou) (Vollmer, Dressed to Rule, p. 52). This necklace, however, only contains 100 red beads, which means it may not be an official court necklace.

,,,,Yang Shanshen,"Chinese, 1913-2004",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1984,,,"Yang Shanshen was a prominent Chinese painter and a leading member of the Lingnan School of Painting. After studying art in Japan at Domoto Art Institute from 1935-1938, Yang moved to Macau in 1941 and established the Xieshe Art Society with Gao Jianfu and Feng Kanghou. Xieshe Art Society sought to modernize traditional Chinese painting by incorporating techniques and ideas from Western art while emphasizing local landscapes, people, and customs. He was known for his use of a technique called ""splashed ink,"" in which he would splatter ink onto the paper to create abstract patterns and textures. Also, Yang's works were characterized by soft, delicate brushwork and a muted colour palette. which helped him to establish a distinct style in the Chinese art world. In 1970, he founded the Chunfeng Painting Society to teach painting and received an honorary degree from the Chinese Academic Research Institute in Taiwan. Yang's contributions to the arts were recognized by the Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region) Government, which awarded him the silver medal ""Bauhinia Star"" and the Guangzhou municipality Government, which declared him an Honorary Citizen of Guangzhou.

2005.5.546.2,,,,unknown,,textiles,,,,,,,,,Gift of Sandy and Cécile Mactaggart,,Chinese,,,1862-1874,,,"Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. 
This rank badge features a peacock, representing a third rank civil official. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges. It is perched on a rock and gazing at a sun disc in the top left corner. The eight Buddhist treasures are scattered throughout the design, including a parasol, endless knot, lotus blossom, victory banner, wheel, vase, carp, and conch shell.

According to the seals, the album was once in the Yuanming Yuan collection owned by the Qianlong Emperor (1711-1799).
These album leaves are part of a section of the illustrations of costumes from the Qianlong court, Huangchao liqi tushi (“The Regulations for the Ceremonial Paraphernalia of the [Qing] Dynasty”). Qianlong Emperor commissioned Prince Yunlu (1695-1767) to lead the editorial team, including scholar-officials and painters, in compiling the final regulations, which were published in 1759. Aside from costumes, Huangchao liqi tushi also includes descriptive texts and colourful illustrations of the instruments and devices used in imperial rituals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Chinese calligraphy in black ink on each page identifies the user and the objects' function.

,,,,Lai Shaoqi,"Chinese, 1915-2000",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1987,,,"Lai Shaoqi, hailing from Puning, Guangdong province, is renowned for his woodblock prints and paintings. He began studying woodcutting techniques after receiving his degree from the Guangzhou Academy of Fine Arts in 1936. He later became a prominent member of the New Woodcut Movement, which was initiated by the renowned writer and scholar Lu Xun, during the 1930s and 1940s. Lai received guidance and encouragement from Lu Xun, who also introduced his works to the ""Complete World Art"" (世界美術全集) published in Japan in 1936, as well as to the Soviet Union, France, and England. Lu Xun praised Lai Shaoqi and his peers as ""the most combatant young woodcutters.” Lai's woodblock prints typically feature landscapes and natural scenes, with an emphasis on the interplay of light and shadow. Furthermore, he has produced prints that depict various cultural and historical events that reflect the theme of the War of Resistance, which was the prolonged conflict between China and Japan that began with the Marco Polo Bridge Incident in 1937 and culminated in Japan's capitulation in 1945.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Lai Shaoqi,Chinese,hanging scroll,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://search.museums.ualberta.ca/g/14-9007

2005.5.557.2,,,,unknown,,textiles,,,,,,,,,Gift of Sandy and Cécile Mactaggart,,Chinese,,,1821-1850,,,"Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a bear embroidered in gold metal-wrapped and multicoloured silk floss, which represents a fifth rank military official. Bears and lions are often confused on rank badges, as the bear has a mane and tail that appears similar to a lion's. However, a bear's tail curls only at the base, whereas a lion's tail curls at the base and tip. A lion also has a curly mane, while a bear's mane hangs in straight tendrils. 
The front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. The sun on the right side of these badges indicates that the wearer was female, likely the spouse of a military official. The bear, positioned at the center of the badge, is surrounded by flames, clouds, rocks, and standing water waves. A flaming wheel, a Buddhist symbol, can be seen amongst the waves with other obscured treasures. There are bats throughout the sky, which are a symbol of good luck. Many flowers are embroidered in the background, including peonies. Gold metal-wrapped threads outline auspicious symbols and also make up the geometric border design.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,gold wrapped silk thread; silk; silk floss; silk satin; embroidery,"Embroidery

Early Qing badges used gold-wrapped thread embroidered in dense rows, carefully outlining each motif until the background was completely filled.

The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a crane, which is identified by its red crown and white feathers. The crane is standing on a rock amidst multi-coloured waves, pink peonies, trees, and clouds. The motifs on these badges, which are identical for the front and back, have been rendered in tapestry weave with a brilliant gold background.

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges. 
This rank badge features a golden pheasant, representing a second-rank civil official. It is perched on a rock and gazing at a sun disc in the top left corner. Surrounding the birds in this badge are clouds and waves.

The foreground is dominated by geometrically-shaped residential houses, which accurately capture the characteristics of white-walled and black-tiled Jiangnan style residential buildings. The background, mainly delineated by curvilinear lines, presents the ebb and flow of the sea. In the upper right corner of the painting, Wu Guanzhong wrote, “Ten days in the fishing village reminiscing about Shitang, busy with work all day and night, the islanders have no time to enjoy the sea waves.” This suggests the overall nostalgic tone of the painting – the artist’s longing for Shitang.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Signed by Wu Guanzhong.,,,,,,ink and colour on paper,,,sheet: 83.5 cm x 106.1 cm; image: 68.1 cm x 86.9 cm,,,,painting,,,,Modern 20th century,,,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Fishing Village,,,,,,https://search.museums.ualberta.ca/21-19075

2008.14.10.1.12,,,,"Kataoka, Shikō",,,,,,,,,,,Gift of the artist,,,Japanese,,2008-01,,,"This poem was written in 1912 when Yosano Akiko was on her way to meet her husband in Paris. She had sent him to Europe to help him overcome depression, but then could not bear to be separated from him, and made the trip all alone on the Trans-Siberian Railway to rejoin him. This poem describes her feelings as the train was approaching Paris through fields of red poppies. 

Kataoka's calligraphic rendering of the poem is very free, like the spirit of the poet herself. The composition is split into two sections, one grouping of five lines in the upper half of the paper and a second grouping of six lines in the lower half. As was the custom in the early 20th Century, the artist has used Chinese characters to transcribe the word “France” rather than using katakana. The repeated word kokuriko is a phonetic transcription of the French word for poppy, coquelicot. 

In the album format, the poem facing this one is on red paper. Kataoka did not want to use red again, feeling that putting a poem about red poppies on red paper was too simplistic. Instead, she wanted the viewer to feel the red of the poppies vibrating in the neighboring poem and chose a soft gold paper for the Yosano Akiko poem to suggest the richness of her feeling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ink on hand-made paper,,,sheet: 33 cm x 24 cm; image: 23.6 cm x 17.8 cm,,,,album leaf,,,,,,,,"Japan: Hyōgo, Takarazuka",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Album leaf from Shikō Kataoka's Ferris Wheel,,,,,https://media.museums.ualberta.ca/UAAC/ppt/2008/08_014_010_001_012s01v01.jpg,https://search.museums.ualberta.ca/11-22603

2005.5.346.1,,,,unknown,,textiles,,,,,,,,,Gift of Sandy and Cécile Mactaggart,,Chinese,,,1662-1722,,,"Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. 
This rank badge displays a mandarin duck, representing a seventh rank civil official. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges. Early Qing badges used gold-wrapped thread embroidered in dense rows, carefully outlining each motif until the background was completely filled. The bird is perched on a scholar's rock, which is a particularly-shaped rock appreciated by the literati and found in Chinese gardens. The rock is stitched with peacock-feather twisted thread.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,gold wrapped silk thread; silk floss; silk satin; peacock feathers; embroidery; glass; wood,"Embroidery

In the centre of the badge, a silver pheasant, standing on rocks above waves, looks toward a red sun in the upper left corner.

The Nō Play Shōjō is based on a Chinese folk tale about a man named Kōfū who was rewarded for his filial piety with an auspicious dream that predicted he would become wealthy if he opened a wine shop. He did and prospered. Then he became curious about one customer who came in everyday. When Kōfū questioned the customer about his origin, the man confessed that he was actually a shōjō, a kind of water sprite dwelling in the waters of the Yangzi River. Kōfū went down to the river one moonlit night with a cask of wine and waited for his friend to appear in his true form. The sprite arrived to drink a chrysanthemum wine with him and dance over the waves.

""My name is Kōfū; I am a citizen of this village by the Yangzi at the foot of Gold Mountain in Cathay. Now, thanks to the filial love I have shown my parents, one night I saw a marvelous dream...""

""We will never grow old. The name of this medicine is chrysanthemum wine. The wine cup floats out on the waves; meeting this friend fills me with joy.""

Each of the embroidered roundels contains a swirling pattern of peonies and butterflies, and brightly coloured with synthetic aniline dyes, which were introduced to China from Europe at the end of the nineteenth century. Peonies, the “king of flowers” in Chinese culture, were a popular motif in the Qing Dynasty and could be found on garments, furnishings, paintings, and other material culture. The two butterflies at the center of each roundel may represent a harmonious couple, referred to as the “butterfly lovers” in an ancient Chinese romantic legend
The wide sleeves on this robe have horse-hoof shaped cuffs that mimic those found on dragon robes during the Manchu reign of the Qing Dynasty. The rocks, waves, and standing water motifs found above the hem of this robe also reference the earlier robes of the imperial court. Auspicious symbols, including those from Buddhism, can be found amongst the rocks, including dragons, wan characters, canopies, the flaming wheel of the law, lotus flowers, and the endless knot. This robe was likely worn by a woman on her wedding day, based on the symbols for longevity and lucky red colour of the ground fabric, which symbolizes fertility and love.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,red silk satin embroidered with silk,"Embroidery

The composition is balanced with foliage in the foreground, depicted in detailed brushwork, contrasting the simplicity of the river and sky. The color palette is muted, with earth tones and soft grays dominating the figures’ robes, while the touch of red in the leaves adds a hint of vibrancy.

This rank badge pair was decorated with smooth satin stitches surrounded by couched metal-wrapped threads. Bats (which represent fortune) and auspicious motifs are scattered among coin-shaped clouds. The background is filled with green geometric lines and  wan symbols (similar in form, but not ideology, to a swastika), which symbolize infinity. In the centre of the badge is a silver pheasant standing on rocks above the waves and water, looking toward a red sun in the upper right corner.

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a bear embroidered in gold metal-wrapped and multicoloured silk floss, which represents a fifth rank military official. Bears and lions are often confused on rank badges, as the bear has a mane and tail that appears similar to a lion's. However, a bear's tail curls only at the base, whereas a lion's tail curls at the base and tip. A lion also has a curly mane, while a bear's mane hangs in straight tendrils. 
The front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. The sun on the right side of these badges indicates that the wearer was female, likely the spouse of a military official. The bear, positioned at the center of the badge, is surrounded by flames, clouds, rocks, and standing water waves. A flaming wheel, a Buddhist symbol, can be seen amongst the waves with other obscured treasures. There are bats throughout the sky, which are a symbol of good luck. Many flowers are embroidered in the background, including peonies.

,,,,Wu Guanzhong,"Chinese, born 1919",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1988,,,"Wu Guanzhong was a prominent contemporary Chinese artist. While Wu Guanzhong is best known for his exceptional fusion of traditional Chinese ink painting techniques with Western artistic styles, he also created simple yet powerful abstract forms in some of his works. These forms often reflect his unique perspective on landscapes and natural scenes, resulting in a captivating blend of realism and abstraction in his paintings. He enrolled at the National Arts Academy of Hangzhou in 1936, where he received instruction in both modern Western art and traditional Chinese painting from Lin Fengmian and Pan Tianshou. Wu's artistic repertoire comprises landscapes, cityscapes, and everyday scenes, where he incorporates elements of traditional Chinese ink painting and Western art movements such as Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, and Fauvism. In 1947, Wu received a government scholarship to study at École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, France. Upon his return to China, he joined the faculty of the Central Academy of Art in 1950, teaching watercolor and drawing in the Department of Architecture at Qinghua University before moving to Beijing Normal University (later Beijing Fine Arts Normal College) to teach art in 1956. During his tenure, he created numerous works inspired by the natural beauty of different Chinese regions. Wu received several awards and accolades, including being named Officier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Ministry of Culture in 1991 and appointed as an academician of the Académie des Beaux-Arts in 2002.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Wu Guanzhong,Chinese,painting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://search.museums.ualberta.ca/g/14-9051

The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. 
This rank badge features a xiezhi, a mythical creature with a goat- or ox-like body and a single horn on its head. It is gazing at the sun disk in the upper left corner.

													The colour pattern is variable in this species.  The upperside is black with orange and pale yellow or white bands. The submarginal band consists of small yellow or white spots and the postmedian band is wide and orange.  Ventral hindwing has alternating bands of yellow-orange and cream.  It is smaller (wingspan 32-51 mm), darker on the ventral surface, and has more rounded forewing tips than the similar species: Anicia Checkerspot (E. anicia).
Subspecies beani, named after Thomas Bean of Lake Louise, occurs in the mountains. The Cypress Hills population is of uncertain taxonomic affinity, but has been referred to as E. editha near subspecies hutchinsi (Bird et al 1995). 
The eggs are yellow (Guppy & Shepard, 2001).
Mature larvae are black and white with orange lateral lines at the base of bristles (Layberry et al., 1998; Guppy & Shepard, 2001).

													Edith's Checkerspot is univoltine and overwinters as larvae (Bird et al., 1995; Opler et al., 1995). Larvae eat leaves and flowers and live in loose silk webs; sometimes using different host plants before and after overwintering.  Males perch or patrol all day to find females.  However, adults tend to be poor dispersers (Britten et al., 1995).  Eggs are laid in groups on underside of leaves or on flowers of the host plant (Opler et al. 1995).

The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a silver pheasant representing the fifth rank of a civil official. This bird is identified by its white feathers, white crown with a red stripe and long tail.
The front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. This rank badge pair was decorated with delicate seed stitches, also referred to as “Peking knots” or ta tzu. Gold metal-wrapped thread is couched around some of the colourful motifs as a border. In the centre of the badge, a silver pheasant, standing on rocks above waves, looks toward a red sun in the upper left corner. An embellished canopy floats above the bird, while the Eight Buddhist treasures surround it, including lotuses, the wheel, the parasol, the vase, the conch, the fish and the endless knot.

Yang's distinctive style is characterized by his use of the baimiao technique, a traditional Chinese ink painting method where only the black outlines of the subjects are painted, leaving the unfilled spaces to convey the essence of the painting. In Bamboo and Sparrows, Yang's use of the baimiao technique results in a minimalistic bamboo tree, emphasizing the simplicity and elegance of its natural form. However, the sparrows are painted with a different technique, the mogu or ""boneless"" style, which utilizes diluted colourful ink washes to create soft and delicate textures that evoke the feather texture of the birds. Yang's masterful use of both the baimiao and mogu techniques creates a harmonious contrast between the precise and rough lines of the bamboo and the smooth and fluid ink washes of the sparrows. The composition of the painting is also carefully balanced, with the three sparrows arranged in a triangular formation, creating a dynamic and lively scene.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The scroll is signed by Yang Shanshen and is impressed with 2 artist seals.

An ascending and descending dragon can be found in each medallion in the ground of the surcoat. This surcoat has a typical front opening with five brass buttons, and three vents - two at the sides and one in the back. Garments like this were used to represent the wearer's identity to the broader society and, as such, it would have been worn as an outer garment over robes, as seen in the Family Portrait painting (2007.23.1).

He graduated from the Xi’an Fine Art Academy in 1963 and subsequently became an active member of the China Artists Association (CAA). Wang Ziwu focused on studying the painting techniques of Qi Baishi, Huang Binhong, and Pan Tianshou from 1966 and copied the works of Russian realistic artists like Lebin and Vasily Surikov. Combining these artistic influences, he developed an innovative style in ink and wash painting that emphasized highly-idealized figures and an accurate, detailed, unembellished depiction of portraits. Wang Ziwu paid meticulous attention to details and sought to capture the essence of his subjects in his portraits. He became the director of the research department of the CAA's Shaanxi Branch in 1978, where he continued to create many remarkable works of art throughout the 1970s and 1980s. His paintings were featured in catalogs published during this period, solidifying his reputation as a significant figure in Chinese painting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Wang Ziwu,Chinese,hanging scroll,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://search.museums.ualberta.ca/g/14-9046

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This rank badge, separated from its front panel, features a pair of silver pheasants, representing a fifth-ranked civil official. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges. Surrounding the birds in this badge are peonies, cherry blossoms, and clouds. The lower bird is perched on a scholar's rock, which are particularly-shaped rocks appreciated by the literati and found in Chinese gardens.

The scene depicts a Buddhist temple complex situated along the banks of the Grand Canal. The location is probably in Jinshansi, the Gold Mountain Buddhist temple in Zhenjiang. Inside the stone walls of the complex, an antiques market bustles with activity. Officials wearing yellow robes and palace servants in tasseled court caps examine and purchase porcelain, paintings, and bronze antiquities. The Green Standard Banner of the imperial army is positioned just outside the walls of the temple complex, as if securing the space.
The gem-like color and fine brushwork has led some scholars to believe that this scroll may have been intended as a gift for one of the local officials who hosted the imperial entourage during their tour.

2008.14.5.1,,,,"Kataoka, Shikō",,,,,,,,,,,Gift of the artist,,,Japanese,,2008,,,"The mounting style of this scroll is called maru hyōgu, “round mount” in which the outer framing fabric surrounds the whole work. [For contrast see the mounting of 2008.14.4.1, where three types of fabric are used and the middle surround cuts the scroll into three distinct sections.] The mounting has in addition, two horizontal strips called ichimonji, above and below the work. The backing fabric and horizontal strips are of donsu damask silk in two different floral patterns.

Since the exhibition of Kataoka’s donated works was first held in April (2008), she though it appropriate to include one piece in a spring mood. This line from a Chinese poem by 8th C. poet Cen Can answers that need well. The whole piece including the small characters was written with a large brush. The calligraphy is spirited and bold. In traditional Chinese calligraphy, the mounting is generally made subordinate to the calligraphy work, whereas in Japanese calligraphy the mounting is often considered of equal importance in the creation of the aesthetic whole. Comparing this work with 2008.14.4.1 or with 2008.14.1.1-.2 will make this difference very clear. Here, Kataoka has followed the traditional Chinese practice. The paper is plain and the mounting is restrained.

Embroidery describes the surface decoration of a fabric using a needle to apply thread, yarns, or other materials, including metal-wrapped threads, small pearls and peacock feathers spun into yarns. Often considered a decorative art that represents the height of women’s handiwork, it was an essential part of high-ranking  young women’s education1. There are four main schools of embroidery: Shu embroidery (from Sichan), Xiang embroidery (from Hunan), Su embroidery (from Suzhou) and Yue (from Guangdong) embroidery. Accomplished embroiderers were considered artists in their own right.



Various stitches are made by hand to give a painterly quality to the surface design. Satin stitches in both long and short lengths create depth and movement in the embroidered design. Couching stitches are used to embroider metal-wrapped threads, as the thread would not be strong or flexible enough to go through the fabric. A second thread (a plain silk yarn with no metal foil) in a variety of colours is used to secure the metal-wrapped thread. Furthermore, the high cost of producing metal-wrapped threads meant that the maker would not want to obscure half of the thread length under the fabric surface, as would be the case with typical running stitches. Another frequently used embroidery stitch is the “Peking knot stitch” (also referred to as da zi, the “seed stitch”), in which the threaded needle enters the fabric from the back side, the thread is wrapped around itself three or four times, and the needle returns through the fabric. This stitch is often used to define details or act as a filler2. The patience and preciseness required to successfully execute this stitch required even tension, an exact placing of stitches, and may have caused severe eye strain to the skilled embroiderer.

Related Definitions:

Fiber: Natural (plant or animal) or synthetic material formed into a thread that is longer than it is wide.

Warp: lengthwise yarn that runs from the top to the bottom of the fabric. This yarn is typically held stationary during weaving.

Weft (or Fill or Filling Yarns): crosswise yarn that runs selvedge to selvedge, under and over the warp yarns in varying patterns to create different weave structures.

Yarn: A continuous length of interlocked fibers, which may or may not be twisted.
Plain Weave (or Tabby Weave): the most basic weave structure that consists of one warp and one weft thread intersecting at a right angle. The front and backside of the resulting fabric are the same.

Satin Weave: Four or more weft yarns intersecting with a warp yarn, or vice versa. The resulting floats, which are sections of the yarn that do not intersect, appear on the face of the fabric, producing a very glossy, smooth, and flat appearance.

Twill Weave: one weft thread passing over one or more warp threads and then under two or more warp threads creating diagonal ridges, which are the identifying feature of the resulting fabric.

,,,,Ma Shouzhen,"Chinese, 1548-1604",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1566,,,"As an elite courtesan in the Ming Dynasty (1368 - 1644), Ma Shouzhen (1548 - 1604) was skilled in many fine arts, including poetry, reciting classical literature, dancing, singing, acting, calligraphy and painting. She was born in 1548 in Nanjing, which was known as Jinling at the time, and lived in the popular “pleasure district” along the Qinhuai River. Ma was also known by her style names Yuejiao, meaning “Lunar Beauty”, and  Xianglan, which means “Orchid of the Xiang River” and alludes to one of her favourite subjects to paint - orchids. Orchids were popular painting subjects in relation to courtesans as they represented something fragrant, delicate, and beautiful. Ma also frequently painted bamboo, narcissus, and other literati-approved foliage - which are references to the classical past, virtue and eroticism, but also grew readily in the temperate Jiangnan region. 

Ma Shouzhen began painting around the age of 16 and many of her works were dedicated to her literati clients, including poet and calligrapher Wang Zhideng (1535 - 1612), with whom she had a long-term relationship. The literati, or scholar-officials, wanted to be surrounded by courtesans who were talented and proficient in their areas of interest, including art, prose, and poetry - and Ma’s paintings were in high demand. Courtesans of the Late Ming straddled the dichotomies of masculine and feminine, acting as an intermediary between classes and genders, and were producers and audiences of many different art forms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Ma Shouzhen,Chinese,handscroll,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://search.museums.ualberta.ca/g/14-9020

Early Qing badges used gold-wrapped thread embroidered in dense rows, carefully outlining each motif until the background was completely filled.

													The army stationed in the West successfully achieved its task in 1759. It is only a little more than seven years from the end of the battles, in 1766, that the drawings of the conquests were finished. The painters needed this space of time in order to meticulously inquire into [what] the forms of the camps and battles [looked like] so as to compose their designs. Of the officers and soldiers who left for the campaigns and risked their lives at extreme odds, one out of a hundred survived. Giving their lives to the state ensured that their campaigns were successful, so how could I suggest that they die without recognition? That is why in the Throne Hall of the Purple Effulgent Pole Star (Ziguangge 紫光閣) we have had the portraits painted of those who distinguished themselves. And because of this motivation, we went to the bloody battlefields, we faithfully depicted the circumstances where attacks were made on our strongholds--where we broke the ardour of the enemy, beheaded the generals, and stole the flags--in order to pay homage to their efforts and to celebrate their courage. When I reviewed the military reports I dedicated some poems to them, and I rewrote them to be placed between the folios. For the six scenes that I have not yet touched with my brush [meaning he had yet inscribed them with poetry], I have dedicated special supplementary poems. When I hear the sound of the drums, then I think [I am reminded] of the generals and soldiers, who are our state. These paintings inspired the same feeling in me. Before the completion of these paintings, I constantly imagined myself touring the battleground even during my busy dealings of government affairs at court. Now with these paintings that show everything vividly before my eyes, I feel as if I am commanding the soldiers on the battlefield…

2008.14.7,,,,"Kataoka, Shikō",,,,,,,,,,,Gift of the artist,,,Japanese,,2008,,,"Kataoka chose as a subject for this work waka poems by two of the famous women poets of the classical period, Princess Shokushi (d. 1201) and Murasaki Shikibu (d. 1014), who is best known as the author of the Tale of Genji. Both of these poems were included in the 13th C. Imperial poetry anthology, Shinkokinshū. This work foregrounds the aesthetics of kana calligraphy and in this respect is a good work to compare with 2008.14.5, which features Chinese calligraphy. The work displays a fine balance between the darkness and lightness of ink, thickness and thinness of line, as well as with the distribution of lines and space on the page.

The outer wooden frame is finished with red tamenuri lacquer.  This type of screen is called a sumitate byōbu, “screen for placing in a corner” but its relatively small dimension makes it appropriate for display in various parts of a room. Kataoka has placed the white paper panels at different levels to create variation in the work’s composition. A further subtlety in the framing of the work is to have the mounting fabric form a square on two corners and a rounded edge on the opposing corners. The metal corner fittings for the screen are sukiiri.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ink on paper mounted on silk,,,overall: 181.6 cm x 121.5 cm x 1.8 cm; image: 136.8 cm x 34.6 cm,,,,painting,,,,,,,,"Japan: Hyōgo, Takarazuka",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cherry Blossoms and Snow,,,,,https://media.museums.ualberta.ca/UAAC/ppt/2008/08_014_007s01v01d03.jpg,https://search.museums.ualberta.ca/11-22273

Brocade describes a type of woven fabric that features a multi-coloured pattern created using a discontinuous supplementary weft structure. Brocade is easily identified by the long floats on the backside of the fabric, which occur when the colourful weft yarns are not in use on the surface design. These floats make the fabric slightly thicker than other multi-coloured fabrics, such as tapestry. Brocade fabric can have a variety of ground fabrics, including twill, plain weave, leno, and satin. Brocade is woven on a complex loom (called a “drawloom”)  that is operated by two weavers: one on the top of the loom (“drawboy”) and a second craftsperson operating the lower section. 

Related Definitions:

Fiber: Natural (plant or animal) or synthetic material formed into a thread that is longer than it is wide.

Warp: lengthwise yarn that runs from the top to the bottom of the fabric. This yarn is typically held stationary during weaving.

Weft (or Fill or Filling Yarns): crosswise yarn that runs selvedge to selvedge, under and over the warp yarns in varying patterns to create different weave structures.

Yarn: A continuous length of interlocked fibers, which may or may not be twisted.
Plain Weave (or Tabby Weave): the most basic weave structure that consists of one warp and one weft thread intersecting at a right angle. The front and backside of the resulting fabric are the same.

Satin Weave: Four or more weft yarns intersecting with a warp yarn, or vice versa. The resulting floats, which are sections of the yarn that do not intersect, appear on the face of the fabric, producing a very glossy, smooth, and flat appearance.

Twill Weave: one weft thread passing over one or more warp threads and then under two or more warp threads creating diagonal ridges, which are the identifying feature of the resulting fabric.

Leno: A type of gauze fabric in which two or more warp yarns (up to four) are twisted around a weft yarn to produce a strong but fine, loose, and open fabric.

2005.5.557,,,,unknown,,textiles,,,,,,,,,Gift of Sandy and Cécile Mactaggart,,Chinese,,,1821-1850,,,"Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a bear embroidered in gold metal-wrapped and multicoloured silk floss, which represents a fifth rank military official. Bears and lions are often confused on rank badges, as the bear has a mane and tail that appears similar to a lion's. However, a bear's tail curls only at the base, whereas a lion's tail curls at the base and tip. A lion also has a curly mane, while a bear's mane hangs in straight tendrils. 
The front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. The sun on the right side of these badges indicates that the wearer was female, likely the spouse of a military official. The bear, positioned at the center of the badge, is surrounded by flames, clouds, rocks, and standing water waves. A flaming wheel, a Buddhist symbol, can be seen amongst the waves with other obscured treasures. There are bats throughout the sky, which are a symbol of good luck. Many flowers are embroidered in the background, including peonies. Gold metal-wrapped threads outline auspicious symbols and also make up the geometric border design.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,gold wrapped silk thread; silk; silk floss; silk satin; embroidery,"Embroidery

The front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. This rank badge pair was decorated with smooth satin stitches surrounded by couched metal-wrapped threads. Bats (which represent fortune) and auspicious motifs are scattered among coin-shaped clouds. The background is filled with green geometric lines and  wan symbols (similar in form, but not ideology, to a swastika), which symbolize infinity. In the centre of the badge is a silver pheasant standing on rocks above the waves and water, looking toward a red sun in the upper right corner. The position of the sun on the right side of the badge indicates that the badge was used by the spouse of a civil official and decorated with her husband’s rank.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,gold wrapped silk thread; silk; silk floss; silk satin; silver wrapped silk thread; embroidery,"Embroidery

Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges. This bird is perched on a rock and gazing at a sun disc in the top left corner. This badge is woven in tapestry, with gold metal-wrapped thread and details rendered in multi-coloured silk floss.

2004.19.38,,,,Ren Yi,,albums,,,,,,,,,Gift of Sandy and Cécile Mactaggart,,Chinese,,,date unknown,,,"This album consists of 12 paintings depicting different scenes of people and animals, accompanied by inscriptions written in regulated verse, featuring four lines of seven characters each (七言绝句). 
The paintings were done by Ren Yi, also known as Ren Bonian (1840-1895). He was born in Shaoxing, Zhejiang. In 1868, he relocated to Shanghai. This move brought him into a more urban environment that was influenced by Western ideas. In Shanghai, he became part of the Shanghai School, which merged popular and traditional artistic styles. Ren Bonian was recognized alongside Ren Xiong, Ren Xun, and Ren Yu as one of the ""Four Rens."" 
The calligraphic poems were crafted by Liu Taixi (1899-1989), a calligrapher commissioned by Zhou Maifu (1929-2011). Based on the inscription on 2004.19.38.20, written by the calligrapher Taixi at the age of 86, the estimated date for the calligraphy is around 1985, nearly 90 years after Ren Yi's death. The time difference indicates that the inscriptions were added to the paintings at a much later date (ca.1985).
The golden-yellow cover is made of damask, featuring swirling cloud motifs and circular medallions containing dragons. This album opens vertically. Once flipped open, the top portion features an inscription, while the bottom half displays a painting framed by a damask border with wavy patterns. Both the inscription and the painting are mounted on a large sheet of yellow paper, with the yellow edges visible around the borders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Each painting is signed by the artist and each painting is also impressed with at least one artist seal.

2005.5.559.2,,,,unknown,,textiles,,,,,,,,,Gift of Sandy and Cécile Mactaggart,,Chinese,,,1875-1908,,,"Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a tiger embroidered in metal-wrapped threads, which represents a fourth rank military official. The tiger is identified by its black stripes and a wan symbol on its forehead, indicating the tiger is a king. 
The front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. The embroidery on this badge is rendered entirely in metal-wrapped threads of varying hues, all expertly couched in place with silk floss. The border contains bats and shou characters, which all act as lucky symbols for the wearer. The tiger is positioned in the middle of the badge, above rocks and standing water waves and surrounded by a sky filled with clouds and lotus flowers. The position of the sun on the right side of the badge indicates that the wearer was a woman, likely the spouse of a military official. The tiger is appliquéd onto the badge background so that it may be easily replaced with other beasts as the military official moves up through the ranks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,gold wrapped silk thread; silk; silk satin; silver wrapped silk thread; embroidery,"Embroidery

There are small groups of buildings throughout the top third of the painting. Cavalry and infantry are in active combat, with many casualties seen spread around the battlefield. Notable figures have small name plates positioned above their heads to identify them to the viewer.
This painting is part of a larger series of approximately 70 paintings commissioned by the Guangxu Emperor in 1885, approved by Empress Dowager Cixi in 1886, and completed in 1890. These paintings - split into four groups - commemorate the Taiping War, the Nian Rebellion, the Muslim Rebellion in Yunnan and Guizhou provinces, and the Muslim Rebellion on the southwest and northwest borders. The military prowess of the Qing government is highlighted and glorified in each of these paintings.

In this scene a man walks towards a stone bridge which spans a small creek within a larger body of water. He is alone in this painting which evokes a feeling of peaceful solace. The trees, rocks, and other natural elements are sharper and darker in the foreground, fading into a mist in the background.

Having studied painting in the 1930s under the guidance of the distinguished Chinese painter and calligrapher, Zhao Shao'ang, Lui relocated to Hong Kong in 1948. Thereafter, he focused on studying traditional Chinese painting and later integrated the concept of Western modernism with ink painting. Lui commenced writing articles on art and exhibition reviews for local newspapers in 1952.  In 1958, he founded the ""New Art Studio"" to teach painting. Four years later, he was appointed as an honorary advisor to the Hong Kong Museum of Art. In 1968, Lui and his students established the ""In Tao Art Association"" and held their inaugural group exhibition at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. In recognition of his contributions to the arts, Lui was awarded an honorary M.B.E. (Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire) by the British government in Hong Kong in 1971.

Her subject for this work is the famous line by the 9th C. Chinese poet Bai Juyi or Hakurakuten Ch. Bai Luotien, (as he is known best in Japan. ) The line goes: “When there is snow, moon or blossoms, I recall you the most.”  The line itself is revered for its expression of the power the beauty of the four seasons has to move us to appreciate our friends.

The first three characters of this line, “snow moon blossoms” has become a fixed idiomatic phrase for “the beauty of the four seasons”, so much part of the popular vocabulary that it is even the name of a brand of sake. Kataoka felt that the sentiment of the line suited the occasion, but as she was writing it, on the spur of the moment, she found herself writing “snow, blossoms, moon” instead of “snow moon blossoms”. This might be considered a mistake, but afterwards, Kataoka herself felt that her slip of memory was fortuitous and made the phrase seem fresh rather than hackneyed. In the order that she created, she saw an implied metaphorical relationship between the snow and the blossoms and she liked that. The strong and vibrant line of the calligraphy expresses her joy in the moment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ink on paper mounted on silk,,,overall: 162.3 cm x 50.4 cm x 3 cm; image: 137 cm x 34.5 cm; sight: 158.9 cm x 47.1 cm,,,,painting,,,,,,,,"Canada: Alberta, Edmonton",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Snow, Blossoms, Moon",,,,,https://media.museums.ualberta.ca/UAAC/ppt/2008/08_021_002s01v01d01.jpg,https://search.museums.ualberta.ca/11-22263

Damask: Patterned fabric that is reversible, with contrasting sections of lustrous and matte designs. Satin weave is paired with one of the fundamental weave structures - plain, satin, or twill weave - to create the motifs. A Jacquard loom is used to create this fabric, which has design motifs woven into the ground.


Brocade describes a type of woven fabric that features a multi-coloured pattern created using a discontinuous supplementary weft structure. Brocade is easily identified by the long floats on the backside of the fabric, which occur when the colourful weft yarns are not in use on the surface design. These floats make the fabric slightly thicker than other multi-coloured fabrics, such as tapestry. Brocade fabric can have a variety of ground fabrics, including twill, plain weave, leno, and satin. Brocade is woven on a complex loom (called a “drawloom”)  that is operated by two weavers: one on the top of the loom (“drawboy”) and a second craftsperson operating the lower section. 

Related Definitions:

Fiber: Natural (plant or animal) or synthetic material formed into a thread that is longer than it is wide.

Warp: lengthwise yarn that runs from the top to the bottom of the fabric. This yarn is typically held stationary during weaving.

Weft (or Fill or Filling Yarns): crosswise yarn that runs selvedge to selvedge, under and over the warp yarns in varying patterns to create different weave structures.

Yarn: A continuous length of interlocked fibers, which may or may not be twisted.
Plain Weave (or Tabby Weave): the most basic weave structure that consists of one warp and one weft thread intersecting at a right angle. The front and backside of the resulting fabric are the same.

Satin Weave: Four or more weft yarns intersecting with a warp yarn, or vice versa. The resulting floats, which are sections of the yarn that do not intersect, appear on the face of the fabric, producing a very glossy, smooth, and flat appearance.

Twill Weave: one weft thread passing over one or more warp threads and then under two or more warp threads creating diagonal ridges, which are the identifying feature of the resulting fabric.

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. 
These rank badges feature an egret, representing a sixth rank civil official. It is couched in silver thread, with its head highlighted in gold. Perched on one leg atop the stone, it gazes at the sun disc in the top right corner. Surrounding the bird are clouds, Daoist emblems, and gold scrolling vines. Additional auspicious symbols, including Buddhist emblems, are interspersed among ruyi-shaped waves along the li shui border at the bottom. The badge is embroidered using fine counted-stitch embroidery on black silk gauze.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,silk thread on silk gauze; metallic threads in gold and silver; embroidering; couching,,,,,,,rank badge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Front and Back Panels of a Rank Badge for a Sixth Rank Civil Official,,,,,https://media.museums.ualberta.ca/UAAC/ppt/2016/16_003_001s01v01.jpg,https://search.museums.ualberta.ca/21-26192

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. 
This pair of rank badges feature a peacock, representing a third rank civil official. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges. It is perched on a rock and gazing at a sun disc in the top left corner. The eight Buddhist treasures are scattered throughout the design, including a parasol, endless knot, lotus blossom, victory banner, wheel, vase, carp, and conch shell.

The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. 
These rank badges feature a flycatcher, representing a ninth rank civil official. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges. The bird perches on rocks, surrounded with bamboo and cherry blossoms.

Tapestry Weave: referred to as ke-si (cut silk or carved silk), is a weft-woven silk fabric that includes undyed warp thread and multiple different-coloured weft threads to create intricate and colourful patterns. The weft threads only pass through specific colourful sections, rather than from selvage to selvage, to create particular patterns in a plain weave. Ke-si fabric has distinctive slits at the edge of each colourful section, which result from the different types of joining techniques used during production. Ke-si fabric is also often completely reversible, depending on the talent of the maker. While the construction is a simple plain weave, the complexity of many differently-coloured yarns means that tapestry fabric can only be woven on a handloom.

This very time consuming and highly skilled technique often results in fabric that mimics paintings, making it highly valued and appreciated. It was often used in panels that were made in the style of paintings and used as household decorations, but can also be found in garments. 

Related Definitions:

Fiber: Natural (plant or animal) or synthetic material formed into a thread that is longer than it is wide.

Warp: lengthwise yarn that runs from the top to the bottom of the fabric. This yarn is typically held stationary during weaving.

Weft (or Fill or Filling Yarns): crosswise yarn that runs selvedge to selvedge, under and over the warp yarns in varying patterns to create different weave structures.

Yarn: A continuous length of interlocked fibers, which may or may not be twisted.
Plain Weave (or Tabby Weave): the most basic weave structure that consists of one warp and one weft thread intersecting at a right angle. The front and backside of the resulting fabric are the same.

2008.21.3,,,,"Kataoka, Shikō",,,,,,,,,,,Gift of the artist,,,Japanese,,"October 9, 2008",,,"Kataoka modeled this handscroll set on a calligraphic work extant from the year 812  by the master calligrapher Monk Kūkai (774-835).  Designated a National Treasure, this work entitled Kanjō rekimei records the names of monks who took part in a Buddhist initiation ceremony that involves the sprinkling of water over the heads of the participants. Kataoka felt some hesitation in aspiring to follow Kūkai’s example, but for a long time, she had wanted to try to do a work like this that would turn a listing of names into art. 

The occasion was the Provost’s Discussion Evening held in her honour on Oct. 9, 2008. She chose a half-cursive mode of calligraphic style that blends the style of Yan Zhenqing (709-785) with that of Mi Fu (1051-1107). Since most of the participants had western names, it was an additional challenge for Kataoka to quickly come up with suitable phonetic renderings using Chinese characters. For example, the Provost’s name, Carl Amrhein is rendered in full as:
ka-ar-u a-mu-ra-in

Sometimes she rendered either just the first or last name, as with Janine Andrews:
an-do-ryu-su.

The artistic composition of the piece was achieved by freely positioning the names over the space of the page rather than writing in lines of the same length. This ability to create an impromtu work of art from the simplest materials marks her as a great calligrapher.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ink on paper; silk; wood; cord,,,,,,,handscroll set,,,,,,,,"Canada: Alberta, Edmonton",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Record of Names,,,,,https://media.museums.ualberta.ca/UAAC/ppt/2008/08_021_003s01v01d02.jpg,https://search.museums.ualberta.ca/11-22264

This painting is the second scroll of 12 and it depicts the royal procession traveling along the Grand Canal after leaving Beijing, about to enter the city of Dezhou in Shandong province.
The handscroll is quite large, measuring 68.5 x 1686.5 cm, and is viewed from right to left. The painting begins with a poetry inscription by Yu Mingzhong (1714-1779) and has two small seals after his signature. Seven of Emperor Qianlong's seals are impressed on the scroll at the beginning of the painting, including three big square red seals. 
On the right side of the scroll, the painting features the emperor's escorts and procession. They are crossing the Grand Canal on a floating bridge, surrounded by crowds of local officials and other inhabitants kneeling on either shore, welcoming the Emperor’s procession.
Further along in Dezhou, we see officials and other residents anticipating the Emperor’s arrival, as well as architecture and daily life activities in the 18th century. After Dezhou, moving left along the scroll, we see the suburbs outside of the town. Several mounted officers, some of them pulling carts, seem to be part of an advanced imperial entourage going ahead to scout the path for Qianlong Emperor’s smooth journey (Tsang, Ka bo, 2008).
At the left end of the picture impressed a small rectangular red seal by the collector Jin Cheng (1879-1926).

2004.19.75.1,,,,Wang Hui,,paintings,,,,,,,,,Gift of Sandy and Cécile Mactaggart,,Chinese,,,1698,,,"Emperor Kangxi (r.1661-1722), the third monarch of the Qing Dynasty, made six tours to southern China from 1684 to 1707. He commissioned imperial artist Wang Hui (1632-1717) to document the second tour in 12 handscrolls. This painting is the seventh scroll of the series, which depicts the route from Wuxi to Suzhou during the Emperor’s second tour in 1689.
The front fringe of the mounted scroll has one label with three parts: “the picture of the southern inspection tour” (nan-xun-tu), “the seventh scroll “ (di-qi juan), and “the route from Wuxi county to the emperor’s accommodation at Suzhou’s official residence” (zi-wuxi-xian zhubi suzhou-fu). At the beginning of the handscroll, which is viewed from right to left, a poetry inscription, titled “Reverence picture of the seventh scroll”, describes people welcoming the Emperor’s procession along the route. The poetry also honours Emperor Kangxi for his mercy and granting tax waivers to the Suzhou people. The scroll bears no red seals.
Following the inscription, the painting begins with the countryside scenery of Qingyuan, Huishan temple, and Xishan. Further along, we see Wuxi county with boats on the river and busy streets along the canal. Afterwards, the scenery shows Xin-an, Hu-shu-guan (a bustling city with cargo ships and tax collecting near the Grand Canal), Shan-tang, and Hu-Qiu. In all of these places there is flourishing urban life, both on the streets and the river.

2005.5.547.2,,,,unknown,,textiles,,,,,,,,,Gift of Sandy and Cécile Mactaggart,,Chinese,,,1875-1908,,,"Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a goose, which represents the fourth rank of a civil official.
The front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. This rank badge pair was decorated with counted stitch embroidery made from polychrome silk floss and metal-wrapped threads. In the center of the badge is a goose standing on rocks and surrounded by waves. The bird is looking toward a red sun at the upper left corner. Blue curvilinear clouds fill the background of the top of the badge, while interlinked ruyi clouds form a line underneath the waves. The bottom shows diagonal stripes, representing standing water, woven in two-toned metal-wrapped threads. The Eight Buddhist Treasures are scattered throughout, including the parasol, canopy, endless knot and lotus in the sky, and the vase, fish, conch, and wheel in the waves. The border of the badge features black embroidery with bats (which represent fortune) and longevity characters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,gold wrapped silk thread; linen; silk; silk floss; silver wrapped silk thread; embroidery,"Embroidery

Mythical phoenixes or fenghuang, which are feminine in contrast to the masculine dragon, were reserved for women of the highest rank and they represent their power. Another symbol on the robe appears as two versions of the shou character, which symbolizes longevity. 
Boldly coloured peonies - in pink, mauve, blue, and white - fill the background of the main fabric. These flowers have been expertly rendered in a flat, even satin stitch with an ombre effect, providing dimension to every blossom. Peonies are the flower related to springtime and their inclusion on this robe may represent the feminine beauty of the wearer. The blue background with a mauve border, made from aniline dyes introduced from Europe at the end of the nineteenth century. Although we cannot officially confirm this robe was owned by Empress Dowager Cixi, she was known to have a fondness for peonies, and this style of robe certainly influenced the style of multiple other extant robes.
In the late Qing dynasty, chenyi, or informal court robes, became popular among the imperial elite women as this garment was not regulated by official codes and could be styled in multiple colours, motifs, and shapes, as opposed to more formal robes. In comparison to another informal robe style, the changyi, this robe has narrower sleeves and no side slits. The sleeves follow the general shape of more formal Manchu style robes, which would typically extend longer and end in a horse hoof-shaped cuff, and the inclusion of phoenixes still follows the conventions of formal court attire.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,blue silk satin embroidered with silk and metal-wrapped threads,"Embroidery

2008.14.4.1,,,,"Kataoka, Shikō",,,,,,,,,,,Gift of the artist,,,Japanese,,2008,,,"The mounting style of the scroll is called Yamato jitate. Yamato stands for Japan and this is a unique Japanese style of scroll mounting. It is comprised of three components: the thick upper and thin lower horizontal border of kinran gold brocade immediately adjacent to the work, called ichi monji “letter one” because individually they look like the Chinese character for 1. The middle surround, or nakamawashi,  in this case of checkered damask, and the extension of the scroll length with an upper and a lower piece of silk, which are together called tenchi or heaven and earth. Finally, there are two strips of the same gold brocade as the ichi monji that are suspended from the top roller. These are called fūtai “wind ties” and are meant to move in the slightest bit of breeze.

The content of this work comes from the 11th C. Wakan rōei shū (Japanese and Chinese Poems to Sing), an anthology arranged in an encyclopaedic fashion under general topics. This scroll displays three entries from the Felicitations and Congratulations section.  Kataoka chose verses from this section to express her warm congratulations for the new quarters of the Prince Takamado Japan Centre in Pembina Hall at the University of Alberta. The Wakan rōei shū is comprised of Japanese poems in the traditional waka form (31 syllables) and couplets taken from poems in classical Chinese composed by both Chinese and Japanese poets. In this scroll, reading from the right to the left, there is a couplet from a poem done by a 7th C. Chinese poet, an anonymous Japanese waka in the middle and a couplet from a Chinese poem composed by a Japanese poet of the 10th C. 

Kataoka has given three different calligraphic treatments to the three entries. The first couplet by the Chinese poet is written with thick strokes in a calligraphic style, that is, however, known as wayō tai (Japanese style). It is a formal way of writing Chinese that has been softened with a cursive touch. The middle waka shows the distinctive style of writing that was developed for the Japanese kana phonetic script. Kana evolved from writing Chinese characters with radical abbreviation and a high degree of cursiveness. In addition, the composition of the lines on the page is very free, in a style known as chirashigaki “scattered writing”. The Chinese couplet by the Japanese poet is written in a moderately cursive style, which is, however, to a calligraphy expert’s eye recognizable as a traditional Chinese style. The Wakan rōei shū anthology itself brings together Chinese and Japanese verse in a spirit of cheerful syncretism and Kataoka has complemented this with her calligraphic treatment , which gives a Japanese style to the Chinese poet’s couplet and a Chinese style to the Japanese poet’s couplet, joining the two together with  the light and tensile Japanese script in the middle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ink on dyed paper mounted on silk,,,overall: 127.1 cm x 68 cm x 2.7 cm; image: 31.9 cm x 50 cm,,,,hanging scroll,,,,,,,,"Japan: Hyōgo, Takarazuka",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Felicitations and Congratulations,,,,,https://media.museums.ualberta.ca/UAAC/ppt/2008/08_014_004_001s01v01.jpg,https://search.museums.ualberta.ca/11-22693

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a leopard rendered in tapestry weave with details painted with ink, representing a third rank military official. The leopard is identified by its spots, which look like geometric marks throughout its body, and green eyebrows, which are typical in the late Qing dynasty. The front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. The leopard is positioned in the center of the badge, surrounded by clouds, small white flowers, bats, and other auspicious symbols. Select details are highlighted with metal-wrapped threads, including the standing water waves below the leopard. The position of the sun on the right side of the badge indicates that the wearer was a woman, likely the spouse of a military official.

There are colourful clouds scattered around the dragons, with four sets of clouds forming a ring in the centre, where they would have initially surrounded the neckline of a robe. Woven waves and rocks provide a border around the petal shape. 
At close inspection, the dark brown background is a satin damask with a continuous cloud pattern. Both the background damask and dragon brocade were woven in one piece.

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. 
This rank badge features an egret, representing a sixth rank civil official. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird was seen on rank badges. The egret in this badge is surrounded by ruyi-shaped clouds, with its wings outstretched and its gaze fixed on the sun disk in the upper left corner. This badge is woven in tapestry, with a ground made from metallic thread.

2005.5.559,,,,unknown,,textiles,,,,,,,,,Gift of Sandy and Cécile Mactaggart,,Chinese,,,1875-1908,,,"Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a tiger embroidered in metal-wrapped threads, which represents a fourth rank military official. The tiger is identified by its black stripes and a wan symbol on its forehead, indicating the tiger is a king. 
The front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. The embroidery on this badge is rendered entirely in metal-wrapped threads of varying hues, all expertly couched in place with silk floss. The border contains bats and shou characters, which all act as lucky symbols for the wearer. The tiger is positioned in the middle of the badge, above rocks and standing water waves and surrounded by a sky filled with clouds and lotus flowers. The position of the sun on the right side of the badge indicates that the wearer was a woman, likely the spouse of a military official. The tiger is appliquéd onto the badge background so that it may be easily replaced with other beasts as the military official moves up through the ranks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,gold wrapped silk thread; silk; silk satin; silver wrapped silk thread; embroidery,"Embroidery

The overall composition reveals artist Zhang Hong’s diligent study of Chinese “orthodox” landscape painting skills. Orthodox painting focuses on the natural world and the depiction of landscapes as idealized and harmonious spaces, with an emphasis on brushwork, composition and the use of ink wash. Zhang incorporates orthodox school techniques in his painting through the use of brushstrokes to create a sense of movement and dynamism, as well as the delicate balance of gradient tones to depict natural elements. His emphasis on negative space in the depiction of clouds and waterfalls is a technique often used in the orthodox school, and helps to create a sense of depth and space within the painting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Signed Zhang Hong.,,,,,,ink and colour on paper,,,sheet: 207.6 cm x 82.4 cm; image: 94.9 cm x 64.5 cm,,,,hanging scroll,,,,Modern 20th century,,,,"United States: New York, New York",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Pink Mountains,,,,,https://media.museums.ualberta.ca/UAAC/fullres/2004/2004_019_007_d01_s22-02v01.jpg,https://search.museums.ualberta.ca/21-19072

The front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. The embroidery on this badge is rendered entirely in metal-wrapped threads of varying hues, all expertly couched in place with silk floss. The border contains bats and shou characters, which all act as lucky symbols for the wearer. The tiger is positioned in the middle of the badge, above rocks and standing water waves and surrounded by a sky filled with clouds and lotus flowers. The position of the sun on the right side of the badge indicates that the wearer was a woman, likely the spouse of a military official. The tiger is appliquéd onto the badge background so that it may be easily replaced with other beasts as the military official moves up through the ranks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,gold wrapped silk thread; silk; silk satin; silver wrapped silk thread; embroidery,"Embroidery

The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a goose, which represents the fourth rank of a civil official.
The front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. This rank badge pair was decorated with counted stitch embroidery made from polychrome silk floss and metal-wrapped threads. In the center of the badge is a goose standing on rocks and surrounded by waves. The bird is looking toward a red sun at the upper left corner. Blue curvilinear clouds fill the background of the top of the badge, while interlinked ruyi clouds form a line underneath the waves. The bottom shows diagonal stripes, representing standing water, woven in two-toned metal-wrapped threads. The Eight Buddhist Treasures are scattered throughout, including the parasol, canopy, endless knot and lotus in the sky, and the vase, fish, conch, and wheel in the waves.

The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a silver pheasant representing the fifth rank of a civil official. This bird is identified by its white feathers, white crown with a red stripe and long tail.
The front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. This rank badge pair was decorated with delicate seed stitches, also referred to as “Peking knots” or ta tzu. Gold metal-wrapped thread is couched around some of the colourful motifs as a border. In the centre of the badge, a silver pheasant, standing on rocks above waves, looks toward a red sun in the upper left corner. An embellished canopy floats above the bird, while the Eight Buddhist treasures surround it, including lotuses, the wheel, the parasol, the vase, the conch, the fish and the endless knot.

2005.5.105,,,,unknown,,clothing,,,,,,,,,Gift of Sandy and Cécile Mactaggart,,Tibetan,,,date unknown,,,"This robe is a traditional style of Tibetan robe, or a chuba, made from yellowish-orange damask with vivid brocade, on the top and the bands on cuffs and skirt, woven together into one fabric, which was imported from China. In Tibet  it was constructed in the local style: right side opening with overlapping front, long narrow sleeves, and a full length hem.
The pattern design was influenced by a Ming-era court robe cloth from the 17th century, or possibly even earlier. Two large dragons wind across the shoulders in a petal shape and a band along the hem and cuffs features more dragons. The yellowish-orange ground fabric is satin damask with cloud motifs.
Underneath the overlap there are patches cut from different fabrics and pieced together. The lining is a green cotton cloth printed with dragon and auspicious motifs. This printed cotton can be traced to the early 20th century. The robe demonstrates how Tibetans used vintage Chinese silk and new cotton fabric to create their unique style of garment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,orange-brown silk damask brocaded with silk and metal-wrapped threads,"Brocade; Damask

The Qin bridge is the legendary place where Qin Shi Huang, founder of the Qin Dynasty and Emperor, fed his horses on his eastern tour. The upper part of the scroll is mainly composed of rocky mountain cliffs, with the Qin bridge and a house below. Lai Shaoqi (1915 -2000) employs different-sized colour blocks to represent the unusual rocks and utilizes comparatively fine brush strokes to sketch the house under the mountain. He uses diluted ink, ochre, and stone blue (shi qing, 石青) in layers to create a heavy, yet tranquil painting. Contrast between the white of the modest house at the bottom of the hill and the slightly muted hues of the rocks on the cliff adds interest to the composition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"…

2005.5.269,,,,unknown,,clothing,,,,,,,,,Gift of Sandy and Cécile Mactaggart,,Tibetan,,,date unknown,,,"This robe is a traditional style of Tibetan robe, or a chuba, made from embroidered yellow silk satin fabric, which was initially made for a dragon robe and imported to Tibet from the Qing imperial court. In Tibet, tailors modified the collar and sleeves to  suit the local style better. Thus the robe has yellow satin parts, without embroidery patterns, around the neckline and sleeve ends. The robe features motifs of dragons with flaming pearls, long thin clouds, rocks, waves and colourful striped water at the hem. There are eight dragons on the exterior of the robe: one on the chest, one on the back, one on each shoulder, and two on the front and back of the lower robe. As is typically seen in Chinese dragon robes, there is a hidden ninth dragon underneath the right overlap.
There are the Twelve Symbols embroidered on the robe: the sun with a three-legged bird and the moon with a rabbit are placed on shoulders, stars and mountains are above the dragon’s head on the front and back, dragons, a pheasant, an axe, the fu symbol, cups, seaweed, flames, and grain. The placement of these symbols align with the Qing imperial costume regulations for the emperor’s dragon robe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yellow silk satin embroidered with silk and metal-wrapped threads,"Embroidery

There is a crane depicted on the square rank badges, identifying the wearer as a first-rank civil official. Cranes are illustrated with red caps and this crane has a vibrant one against the gold metal-wrapped thread couched into the rest of the badge. The position of the sun, the only other red spot in the badge, on the left side of the badge (the wearer's right side) indicates that the wearer is a man. The Buddhist eight auspicious signs surround the crane - from the top, clockwise: lotus, parasol, wheel of the law, victory banner, conch, fish, endless knot, and vase. Below the crane are waves and rocks with standing water underneath. This surcoat has a typical front opening with five brass buttons, and three vents - two at the sides and one in the back. Garments like this were used to represent the wearer's identity to the broader society and, as such, it would have been worn as an outer garment over robes, as seen in the Family Portrait painting (2007.23.1).

													From mother one is given form.
From father one is given disposition [nature].
[One must] cultivate one's nature to know the Heaven in oneself.
[One must] cultivate one's form to realize one's destiny.
A great man tramples his form. A gentleman waits for his fate.
If one cannot comprehend this, one should seek it from old books.
Days and months accumulate, one either searches or is at rest.
[He should continue to] investigate and put into practice [his findings].
Beasts who are gentle can be domesticated.
A man who is good can be your teacher.
The crux lies in stillness,
No longer responsive but frozen and congealed.
A man of courage would compare himself to an ancient fool.
Entering this world, he would avoid harming others.
Exiting this world, he would bring compassion.
Shedding ignorance, and seeking enlightenment,
How wise would one become?
[Wang] Yangming realized it, for oneness is all.
[Chen] Baisha rose to a heavenly principle,
A hundred days he immersed himself in quietude.
The hawk flies and the fish leaps; 
To these one can bear witness.
Is this the Guang school or the Zhe school?
Each had its own foundation.
Buddhism teaches that all are empty.
Immortals are beyond worldly cycles.
Each has its own beliefs. Each has its own uniqueness.

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges. 
This pair of rank badges features a golden pheasant, representing a second-rank civil official. It is perched on a rock and gazing at a sun disc in the top left corner. Surrounding the birds in this badge are clouds and waves. These badges are made with gold and silver metal-wrapped thread and details rendered in multi-coloured silk floss.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,gold wrapped silk thread; silk; silk gauze; silk satin; silver wrapped silk thread; beads; silk floss; embroidery,"Embroidery

This leaf depicts an ink and watercolour drawing of a husband and wife in mourning dress “after the loss of [a] father”. During the Qing dynasty, mourning costume, or sangfu, was white or light coloured and was meant to be worn for a specified period of time, depending on the relationship of the mourner to the decedent and the decedent’s social status. The female figure, on the left, wears a white cloth covering her head, as well as a long white jacket over a light brown pleated skirt (likely made from hemp). She also appears to have bound feet, and may be of Han descent. The male figure, on the right, wears a light brown hat and robe (also likely made from hemp) over white leggings.

This leaf depicts and ink and watercolour drawing of two female figures, possibly of Han ancestry and of a lower social standing. The woman on the left is slightly better dressed in a decorated pleated skirt, mid-length robe with cuffed wide sleeves, and short vest. Her higher standing may be indicated by her bound feet, bangles on each arm, and hair pin. She also carries a handkerchief and a small fan. The woman on the right is wearing a mid-length jacket over a pleated skirt and pants – an outfit that is not decorated and better suited for working.

The silk multicoloured tapestry has motifs of dragons, clouds, waves and rocks. The green silk brocade with metal-wrapped threads is patterned with floral and xi characters, which mean happiness.
The inner section is pieced together from fragments of Chinese tapestry. That shows two dragons face to face, yet one of the dragons has been cut off on the right side. The dragons, which have four claws on each foot,  are both standing on one leg. Their  heads face upward with open mouths that show off their pointy white teeth. The ends of their tails resemble fishtails sweeping the tops of the waves and mountains below. The images of the dragons’ postures, sharp teeth, fierce claws, and muscular tails reveal a design style of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,gold wrapped silk thread; silk brocade; polyester; silk tapestry weave; silk twist,"Tapestry Weave; Brocade
